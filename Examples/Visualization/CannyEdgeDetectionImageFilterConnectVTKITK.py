# This file demonstrates how to connect VTK and ITK pipelines together
# in scripted languages with the new ConnectVTKITK wrapping functionality.
# Data is loaded in with VTK, processed with ITK and written back to disc
# with VTK.
#
# For this to work, you have to build InsightApplications/ConnectVTKITK
# as well.
#
# It also demonstrates the use of the python-specific itkPyCommand object.

# the subsequent ITK pipeline; two-dimensional float type

# Call the magic function that connects the two.  This will only be
# available if you built ITK with ITK_CSWIG_CONNECTVTKITK set to ON.

# our ITK pipeline an Update() call... this is not necessary
# for normal error-less operation, but ensures that exceptions
# thrown by ITK get through to us in the case of an error;
# This is because the VTK wrapping system does not support
# C++ exceptions.

//  This code instantiates a $3D$ image\footnote{Also known as a
//  \emph{volume}.} whose pixels are represented with type \code{unsigned
//  short}. The image is then constructed and assigned to a
//  \doxygen{SmartPointer}. Although later in the text we will discuss
//  \code{SmartPointer}s in detail, for now think of it as a handle on an
//  instance of an object (see section \ref{sec:SmartPointers} for more
//  information). The \doxygen{Image} class will be described in
//  Section~\ref{sec:ImageSection}.

/**
 * This is a fully working example of SAX-based writer for the ITK object
 * itk::ParticleSwarmOptimizer. It performs the same function as
 * ParticleSwarmOptimizerDOMWriter; however, this writer directly generates
 * the output XML document, which is more complicated and error prone.
 *
 * Please see [ITK_HOME]/Testing/Data/InputXML/test.pso.xml for an example of
 * our XML format for the PSO object.

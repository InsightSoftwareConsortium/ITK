/**
 * This is a fully working example of DOM-based writer for the ITK object
 * itk::ParticleSwarmOptimizer. To demonstrate the power and flexibility of
 * the new DOM-based object writing/reading, we formulate our XML format for
 * the PSO object in a special way, e.g. using children and text nodes
 * (instead of attributes) for some data fields. This may not be the
 * favouriate way for some users, but users can always define their own XML
 * format, and customize this implementation.
 *
 * Please see [ITK_HOME]/Testing/Data/InputXML/test.pso.xml for an example of
 * our XML format for the PSO object.

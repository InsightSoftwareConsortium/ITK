<!-- The text within this markup is a comment, and is intended to provide
guidelines to open an issue for the ITK repository. This text will not
be part of the issue. -->


<!-- Before submitting an issue, please check that your issue has not been
already filed. -->

### Description

<!-- Description of the proposed implementation change. -->

### Impact analysis

<!-- Detailed analysis of the impact of the current implementation in terms of
performance, and how another implementation would benefit the performance of the
toolkit, including the benefits/downsides of both approaches. -->

### Expected behavior

<!-- What you expect the performance to be reasonable. Include a snippet of
what the code would look like. -->
```none
```

<!-- Provide a minimal, complete, compilable, and verifiable example (commonly
abbreviated as MWE, Minimal Working Example, or sometimes referred to as SSEE,
Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable) Example, SSCCE) or code snippet,
either through a GitHub gist (https://gist.github.com/) or providing your own
files (including your source code, `CMakeLists.txt` file if applicable, and your
data) that shows the performance improvement of the change. -->

### Actual behavior

<!-- What actually happens. -->

### Versions

<!-- If a tagged version, you can get this information by inspecting the
`ITK_VERSION_MAJOR` `ITK_VERSION_MINOR` and `ITK_VERSION_PATCH` variable
values in the `ITKConfig.cmake` file.

If the commit number is required, run `$ git rev-parse --short HEAD`. -->

### Environment

<!-- Which your hardware, OS, CMake, and compiler versions are, or your Python
and installed package versions are. -->

### Additional Information

<!-- Any additional information, configuration or data that might be necessary
to reproduce the issue. -->


<!-- **Note**: Use issues for their purpose; issues are not for code help. Need

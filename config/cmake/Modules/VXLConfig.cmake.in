#   also configured by CMake to
# @PROJECT_BINARY_DIR@/VXLConfig.cmake
#
# This CMake module is configured by VXL's build process to export the
# project settings for use by client projects.  A client project may
# find VXL and include this module using the FIND_PACKAGE command:
#
#  find_package(VXL)
#
# After this command executes, projects may test VXL_FOUND for whether
# VXL has been found.  If so, the settings listed below in this file
# have been loaded and are available for use.
#
# Typically, a client project will include UseVXL.cmake from the
# directory specified by the VXL_CMAKE_DIR setting:
#
#  find_package(VXL)
#  if(VXL_FOUND)
#    include(${VXL_CMAKE_DIR}/UseVXL.cmake)
#  else()
#    message("VXL_DIR should be set to the VXL build directory.")
#  endif()

# See vxl/config/cmake/UseVXL.cmake for details.

# VXL has many parts that are optional, depending on selections made
# when building.  The stanzas below give a consistent (though
# pedantic) interface to each part.  Clients use these settings to
# determine whether a part was built (_FOUND), where its headers are
# located (_INCLUDE_DIR) and in some cases what libraries must be
# linked to use the part (_LIBRARIES).  Most client projects will
# likely still refer to individual VXL libraries such as vcl, for
# example, by hard-wired "vcl" instead of using the variable
# VXL_VCL_LIBRARIES, but it is there just in case.

# -Winline warnings aren't included here because, for at least
# GNU compilers, this flag appears to conflict specifically with
# the -Og optimization level flag added for Debug and Developer
# builds and will produce warnings about functions not being
# considered for inlining. The flag will be added to the list
# of compiler flags separately if developer warnings are enabled
# and the build type is not Debug or Developer
#-Winline

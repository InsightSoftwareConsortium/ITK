About
-----

The Insight Toolkit (ITK) is an open-source, cross-platform toolkit for
N-dimensional scientific image processing, segmentation, and registration.
Segmentation is the process of identifying and classifying data found in a
digitally sampled representation. Typically the sampled representation is an
image acquired from such medical instrumentation as CT or MRI scanners.
Registration is the task of aligning or developing correspondences between
data. For example, in the medical environment, a CT scan may be aligned with a
MRI scan in order to combine the information contained in both.

The ITK project uses an [open governance model](./GOVERNANCE.md)
and is fiscally sponsored by [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/). Consider making
a [tax-deductible donation](https://numfocus.org/donate-to-itk) to help the project
pay for developer time, professional services, travel, workshops, and a variety of other needs.

ITK is distributed in binary Python packages. To install:

```
pip install itk
```

or

```
conda install -c conda-forge itk
```

The cross-platform, C++ core of the toolkit may be built from source using
[CMake](https://cmake.org).

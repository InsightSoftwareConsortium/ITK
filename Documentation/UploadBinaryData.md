Uploading binary data in ITK
============================

Since every local [Git] repository contains a copy of the entire project
history, it is important to avoid adding large binary files directly to the
repository. Large binary files added and removed throughout a project's history
will cause the repository to become bloated, take up too much disk space,
require excessive time and bandwidth to download, etc.

A [solution to this problem] which has been adopted by ITK is to store binary
files, such as images, in a separate location outside the Git repository, then
download the files at build time with [CMake].

A "content link" file contains an identifying [SHA512 hash]. The content
link is stored in the [Git] repository at the path where the file would exist,
but with a `.sha512` extension appended to the file name. [CMake] will find
these content link files at **build** time, download them from a list of server
resources, and create symlinks or copies of the original files at the
corresponding location in the **build tree**.

See also our [Data](Data.md) guide for more information.

**Note**: for historical reasons, before [SHA512 hash] files were used in ITK,
[MD5 hash] content link files were used.

Adding images as input to ITK sources
-------------------------------------

[ITK examples] and ITK class tests (see Section 9.4 of the
[ITK Software Guide]) rely on **input** and **baseline** images (or data in
general) to demonstrate and check the features of a given class. Hence, when
developing an ITK example or test, images will need to be added to the [Git]
repository.

When using images for an ITK example or test images, the following principles
need to be followed:

  1. Images should be **small**.
     * The source tree is not an image database, but a source code repository.
     * Adding an image larger than 50 Kb should be justified by a discussion
      with the [ITK community].
  2. Regression (baseline) images should not use [Analyze format] unless the
     test is for the `AnalyzeImageIO` and related classes.
  3. Images should use non-trivial Metadata.
     * Origin should be different form zeros.
     * Spacing should be different from ones, and it should be anisotropic.
     * Direction should be different from identity.

Using Girder to get the SHA512 hash
-----------------------------------

### Prerequisites

The [data.kitware.com] server is an ITK community resource where any community
member can upload binary data files. There are three methods available to
upload data files:

  1. The [UploadBinaryData.sh] shell script.
  1. The [Girder web interface].
  2. The `girder-cli` command line executable that comes with the
     [girder-client] Python package.

Before uploading data, please visit [data.kitware.com] and register for an
account.

Once files have been uploaded to your account, they will be publicly available
and accessible since data is content addressed. Specifically, the
[hashsum_download] plugin in Girder looks through all public (or private if
authenticated) data for files with the given hash. Thus, so as long as the file
is publically available somewhere on [data.kitware.com], ITK will be able to
retrieve the corresponding file.

At release time, the release manager will upload and archive repository data
references in the [ITK collection] and other redundant storage locations.


### Upload via the shell script

The [UploadBinaryData.sh] script will authenticate to [data.kitware.com],
upload the file to your user account's *Public* folder, and create a
`*.sha512` [CMake] `ExternalData` content link file. After the content link
has been created, you will need to add the `*.sha512` file to your commit.

When `./Utilities/SetupForDevelopment.sh` is executed, as described in
[CONTRIBUTING.md], authentication to Girder is configured in Git. If the Git
`girder.api-key` config or `GIRDER_API_KEY` environmental variable is not set,
a prompt will appear for your username and password. The API key can be
created in the data.kitware.com user account web browser interface.

To upload new binary testing data:

  1. Place the binary file at the desired location in the Git repository.
  2. Run the `git data-upload` alias, and pass in the binary file(s) as arguments. E.g.
     `cd ITK; git data-upload ./Modules/Core/Common/test/Input/cthead1.png`.
  3. In the corresponding `test/CMakeLists.txt` file, use the
     `itk_add_test` macro and reference the relative file path with `DATA` and braces.
     E.g.: `DATA{Input/cthead1.png}`.
  4. Re-build ITK, the `ITKData` target specifically, and the testing data will be
     downloaded into the build tree. The path in the build tree is used in test execution.


### Upload via the web interface

  1. After logging in, you will be presented with the welcome page. Click on
     the *personal data space link*.
  2. Next, select the *Public* folder of your personal data space.
  3. Click the green upload button.
  4. Click the *Browse or drop files* to select the files to upload.
  5. Click *Start Upload* to upload the file to the server.
  6. Next, proceed to [Download the Content Link].

### Upload via Python script

A Python script to upload files from the command line, `girder-cli`, is
available with the [girder-client] Python package. To install it, type:

```sh
   $ python -m pip install girder-client
```

To upload files with the `girder-cli` script, we need to obtain an API key and a
parent folder id from the web interface.

  1. After logging in, select *My account* from the user drop down.
  2. Next, select the *API keys* tab.
  3. Create a new API key if one is not available by clickin on *Create new
     key*.
  4. The *show* link will show the key, which can be copied into the command
     line.
  5. Next, select *My Folders* from the user drop down.
  6. Next, select the *Public* folder of your personal data space.
  7. Click the *i* button for information about the folder.
  8. The *Unique ID* can be copied into the command line.

Use both the API key and the folder ID when calling `girder-cli`. For example,

```sh
   $ girder-cli \
       --api-key 12345ALongSetOfCharactersAndNumbers \
       --api-url https://data.kitware.com/api/v1 \
       upload \
       58becaee8d777f0aefede556 \
       /tmp/cthead1.png
```

Next, proceed to [Download the Content Link].

### Download the content link

  1. Click on the file that has been uploaded.
  2. Click on the *i* button for further information.
  3. Finally, click on the *Download key file* icon to download the key file.

Move the content link file to the **source tree** at the location where the
actual file is desired in the build tree. Stage the new file to your commit:

```sh
   $ git add -- path/to/file.sha512
```

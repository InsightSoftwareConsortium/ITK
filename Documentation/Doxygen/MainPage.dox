 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * Welcome to the Insight Toolkit (ITK). ITK is an open-source, cross-platform toolkit
 * for scientific image processing, segmentation, and registration in two, three,
 * or more dimensions.
 *
 * Segmentation is the process of identifying and classifying data found in a
 * digitally sampled representation. Typically the sampled representation is an
 * image acquired from such medical instrumentation as CT or MRI scanners.
 * Registration is the task of aligning or developing correspondences between
 * data. For example, in the medical environment, a CT scan may be aligned with a
 * MRI scan in order to combine the information contained in both.
 *
 * ITK was originally created to analyze 3D images from the Visible Human
 * Project. ITK is now widely applied across medical imaging, microscopy,
 * and remote sensing domains. ITK is actively developed by a community of
 * research software engineers from around the world.

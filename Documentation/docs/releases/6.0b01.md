# ITK 6.0 Beta 1 Release Notes

We are excited to announce the first beta release of ITK 6.0! This major version update marks a significant leap forward in the toolkit's evolution, focusing on code modernization, cleanup, and enhanced performance. As a beta release, we encourage the community to test and provide feedback as we finalize this next generation of ITK.üöÄ ‚ú® üéâ

This release, comprised of 1,115 changes, transitions the toolkit to require C++17, enabling the use of modern C++ features for more elegant, readable, and performant code. Extensive cleanup has been performed, including the removal of APIs deprecated in version 5 and the end of support for ITKv4 compatibility.

*[Visible Human](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/visible_human.html) rendering with [NiiVue](https://niivue.com). ITK 6 includes a new remote module, [ITKIOMeshMZ3](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITKIOMeshMZ3), that provides C++ and Python support for the [MZ3 mesh format](https://github.com/neurolabusc/surf-ice/tree/master/mz3) used by NiiVue.*

- **C++ Modernization**:
    - **C++17 is now required** for building ITK, enabling modern language features
    - Extensive code cleanup replacing legacy macros with `constexpr`, use of `[[nodiscard]]` and `std::string_views`, and contemporary C++ idioms for safer, clearer, and faster code paths
    - Updated third-party libraries including libtiff, HDF5, OpenJPEG, libjpeg-turbo, Nifti, libpng, GDCM, and DCMTK
    - Improved thread safety and performance optimizations
    - ITKv4 compatibility has been removed, and content from the Deprecated module has been purged, resulting in a cleaner, more modern API
- **Platform Support Updates**:
    - Enhanced Apple Silicon (ARM64) macOS support with optimized build configurations
    - Intel macOS support maintained but deprecation started (see [\#5326](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK/issues/5326) and [\#5369](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK/issues/5369))
    - Updated CI/CD infrastructure with GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines improvements
    - Pixi package manager integration for streamlined development workflows
- **New Features and Enhancements**:
    - New `AnatomicalOrientation` class for robust anatomical coordinate system handling
    - Enhanced JPEG2000 support with High Throughput JPEG2000 (HTJ2K) for `.jph` files
    - Updated DCMTK integration with additional modules enabled
- **Code Quality Improvements**:
    - Migrated to clang-format 19.1.7 for consistent code style
    - Removed deprecated code including VNL Netlib rpoly files and legacy macros
    - Enhanced GoogleTest integration and expanded test coverage
    - Large-scale style and readability improvements remove dead code paths, replace trivial functions with defaults, adopt raw string literals where helpful
    - Normalized Doxygen groups and added citations for better documentation
- **Remote Modules**:
    - Updated **70 remote modules**  including `WebAssemblyInterface`, `Montage`, `CudaCommon` and `MorphologicalContourInterpolation`
    - New modules: `ITKIOMeshMZ3` for MZ3 mesh format support

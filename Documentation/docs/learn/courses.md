# Courses

The Insight Toolkit (ITK) is not only a foundation for the practice of image analysis in industry and academia; ITK has been studied and used to demonstrate principles of scientific and medical image analysis in many university courses around the world.

Kitware also offers periodic [short online courses given by expert instructors](https://www.kitware.com/courses/itk/).

Its purpose, from its syllabus, is “to gain theoretical and practical skills in medical image analysis, including skills relevant to general image analysis.  The fundamentals of computational medical image analysis will be explored, leading to current research in applying geometry and statistics to segmentation, registration, visualization, and image understanding. Student will develop practical experience through projects using the new v4 of the National Library of Medicine Insight Toolkit (ITK), a popular open-source software library developed by a consortium of institutions including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.”

- [Image Processing](https://my.eng.utah.edu/~cs6640/) at the University of Utah is an introductory course in processing gray-scale and color images taught at the graduate level. This course covers both mathematical fundamentals and implementation.
- A [Digital and Medical Image Processing course](https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2015/spring/ensc/474/d100) at Simon Fraser University develops signal processing techniques of wide applicability, presented in the context of processing and analysis of digital images, in particular 2D and 3D biomedical images. Covers acquisition, formation and representation of digital images, filtering, enhancement and restoration in both spatial and frequency domains, image segmentation, image registration, and discrete image transforms.
- [Medical Image Science: Applications](https://medphysics.wisc.edu/mp-574/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison presents the application of medical imaging theory to problems in medical imaging science including: concepts of digital image processing, image reconstruction/compression, point response function analysis, noise characteristics, and measurement.
- A [Digital Image Processing course](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~xlx/ee4830/) at Columbia University introduces fundamental technologies for digital image and video representation, compression, analysis, and processing. Students will gain understanding of algorithm and system design, analytical tools, and practical implementations of various digital image applications.
- The [Applied Medical Image Analysis course](https://catalog.odu.edu/courses/bme/) at Old Dominion University explores hands-on exposure to state-of-the-art algorithms in medical image analysis, which builds on open-source software (Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit – ITK), as well as the principles of medical image acquisition in the modalities of clinical interest. Medical imaging modalities – X-rays, CT, and MRI/ITK image pipeline; image enhancement, feature detection; segmentation – basic techniques, feature-based classification and clustering, graph cuts, active contour and surface models; surface and volume meshing; registration – transformations, similarity criteria; shape and appearance models are all explored and discussed in this course.

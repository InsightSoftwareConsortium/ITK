ðŸ“¦ Package managers
-------------------

ITK packages exist for many Linux distributions. For Debian and Ubuntu, they
can be obtained running

```bash
sudo apt-get install libinsighttoolkit5-dev
```

This will give you the libraries and development headers.

In GNU Guix, install ITK with:

```bash
guix install insight-toolkit
```

For information on other ITK packages and packages for other distributions, see
this [blog post].

ITK is available in [vcpkg] as `itk`:

```bash
vcpkg install itk
```

If you're a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) user, you can install [itk](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/itk) via:

```bash
brew install itk
```

ðŸš€ Latest sources with Git
--------------------------

First, [download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Note that the software must be compiled from source using [CMake] and your
favorite C++ compiler. The toolkit can be installed, but it is not necessary;
it can be used directly from its build directory. See the [ITK Software Guide]
for further information on configuring and building ITK.

### Clone

Clone ITK using the commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK
cd ITK
```

The latest stable release can be cloned into a local repository using

```bash
git clone -b release https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK ITKLatestRelease
```
where `ITKLatestRelease` is the name of the local repository created.

Additionally, specific releases can be cloned using the tags, for example:

```bash
git clone -b v5.3.0 https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK ITK-5.3.0
```
where `v5.3.0` corresponds to ITK 5.3.0, and the `ITK-5.3.0` is the name
of the local repository created.

### Update

Users that have made no local changes and simply want to update a clone with
the latest changes may run

```bash
git checkout master
git pull --rebase upstream master
```

Avoid making local changes unless you have read our [developer
instructions](contributing/index.md).

### Checkout

After cloning, your local repository will be configured to follow the upstream
`master` branch by default. This means you will have access to cutting edge
features, but along with these may come cutting edge bugs :grimacing:. One may
create a local branch to track the upstream `release` branch instead, which
should guarantee only bug fixes to the functionality available in the latest
release:

```bash
git checkout --track -b release origin/release
```

This local branch will always follow the latest `release`. Use the [#update]
instructions to update it.

Alternatively, one may checkout a specific release tag using

```bash
git checkout v5.3.0
```

Release tags never move. Repeat the command with a different tag to get a
different release. One may list available tags using:

```bash
git tag
```

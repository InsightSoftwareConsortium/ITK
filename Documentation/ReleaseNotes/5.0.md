ITK 5.0.0 Release Notes
=======================

We are happy to announce the Insight Toolkit (ITK) 5.0.0! :tada: ITK is an open-source, cross-platform toolkit for N-dimensional scientific image processing, segmentation, and registration.

ITK 5.0.0 is a major release that features an incredible number of improvements: This includes major enhancement in the development process, major code refactoring, addition of important features, improvement of ITK Python wrapping, and more.

**Python Packages**

**ITK on GitHub**

An important step has been taken to faciliate participation of the community in the development of ITK: The official repository was moved to GitHub! This move includes [ITK's main repository](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK), as well as many other ITK projects such as the [ITKExamples](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITKExamples), and many [ITK remote modules](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium). It is now very easy for anyone to participate in the development of the library. This has already been a success with many new authors getting involved and submitting patches through the GitHub pull-request mechanism. This change also includes moving the issue tracker to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK/issues) where any problem encountered with ITK should be reported. ITK's GitHub migration was explained in more detail in [ITK 5.0 Beta 3: GitHub](https://discourse.itk.org/t/itk-5-0-beta-3-github/1504). Finally, moving ITK to GitHub made it straightforward to use Microsoft Azure Pipeline Continuous Integration platform: Each pull-request is tested on all 3 major platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS) and Python builds can be requested to ensure that a patch can be integrated.

**C++11**

Major C++ code refactoring brought dramatic improvements to ITK's API and performance (see [ITK 5.0 Alpha 1: Modern C++](https://discourse.itk.org/t/itk-5-0-alpha-1-modern-c/843) for more details). ITK now uses the C\++11 standard allowing the developers full access to its new powerful features such as range-based loops, constexpr, lambda expressions, and uniform initialization syntax. Using C++ 11 also removes the necessity of many ITK macros (e.g. `ITK_NULLPTR`, `ITK_DELETED_FUNCTION`) which have equivalents in the new standard. This also leads to changes in style to match the C++ 11 best practices. This includes replacing `typedef` calls with the `using` keyword to improve source code readability. ITK's C++ code is easier to read, understand, and maintain!

**Thread Pool**

This new release of ITK also integrates big performance improvements thanks to the refactoring of the multithreading infrastructure with a thread pool available by default, and the possible usage of the Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB) threading backend (see [ITK 5.0 Alpha 2: Performance](https://discourse.itk.org/t/itk-5-0-alpha-2-performance/959) for benchmarks).

**Spatial Objects**

Additionally, a major upgrade of the ITK Spatial Object framework, which provides a representation of objects and the mechanism to specify their spatial relationship relative to other objects in a scene, was integrated in this new version of ITK. The new code improves consistency in the programming interface and simplifies implementation and usage (more details in [ITK 5.0 Release Candidate 2: Spatial Objectâ€™s](https://blog.kitware.com/itk-5-0-release-candidate-2-spatial-objects).

**Ranges**

ITK 5.0 has a new [Experimental namespace](https://itk.org/Doxygen/html/namespaceitk_1_1Experimental.html). This namespace includes three _range_ class templates, `ShapedImageNeighborhoodRange`, `IndexRange`, and `ImageBufferRange`, to iterate efficiently over a neighborhood of pixels, the indices of an image region, and the pixels of an image buffer, respectively. These ranges can be used in a C++11 range-base for-loop. Their `begin()` and `end()` can be passed directly to an `std` algorithm.

**New Features**

Other new features in this ITK release include new algorithms, better mesh support (see [ITK 5.0 Release Candidate 1: Meshes](https://discourse.itk.org/t/itk-5-0-release-candidate-1-meshes/1576)), new global variable model using one singleton, and better streaming capabilities.

**Third Party Libraries**

Eigen, a C++ library for linear algebra, was integrated in ITK and gradual transition from VXL to Eigen for Linear algebra is planned. Many third party libraries were updated: VNL, DCMTK, GDCM, HDF5, KWSys, MetaIO, Zlib, GIFTI, nifti, pygccxml.

**Remote Modules**

Remote modules, which allow easy integration of new image processing algorithm in ITK, were updated and new Python packages compatible with this new release of ITK were created. Four new remote modules were also added to ITK: PhaseSymmetry, IOOpenSlide, Montage, and BSplineGradient (description of the modules in [ITK 5.0 Beta 3: GitHub](https://discourse.itk.org/t/itk-5-0-beta-3-github/1504)).

**Python**

Traditionally, ITK in Python had to be used through an object-oriented interface. In this new release, we have added a functional interface which is more Pythonic and should be more familiar to Python programmers. Examples on how to use this new procedural interface are available in  [ITK 5.0 Beta 1: Pythonic Interface](https://discourse.itk.org/t/itk-5-0-beta-1-pythonic-interface/1271).

**Congratulations**

Congratulations and thank you to everyone who contributed to this release. Of the 49 authors, we would like to specially recognize the new contributors, Isaiah Norton, maekclena, Rashad Kanavath, Bai Shi, Hui Xie, Martino Pilia, Ally Warner, pierre33, Chao Wu, Gregory C. Sharp, Bryce A Besler, Kwame Kutten, Mihail Isakov, Jerome Schmid, Roman Grothausmann, Alexis Girault, Gabriel A. Devenyi, Marian Klymov, Thomas Janvier, and Forrest Li.

**Migration to ITKv5**

The [ITK 5 Migration Guide](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK/blob/master/Documentation/ITK5MigrationGuide.md) is available to help transition a code base from ITK 4 to ITK 5. Please discuss your experiences on [Discourse](https://discourse.itk.org).

What's Next

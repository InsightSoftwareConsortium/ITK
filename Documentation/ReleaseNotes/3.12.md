        ENH: suppress deprecated header warnings for gcc compilers that support it.
        COMP: remove redundant library from TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES.
        ENH: Increasing the minor release number to "11", to initiate a new development cycle.

    GettingStarted.txt
        ENH: Clarifying that depending on the shell you should use "setenv" or "export".

    Applications/README.txt
        ENH: testing

    CMake/CTestCustom.ctest.in
        COMP: suppress warnings that cannot be resolved.

    Code/Algorithms/itkBayesianClassifierImageFilter
        BUG: 8369 Use to SetVectorLength (and other output information) in the AllocateOutputs method. This should be called in the UpdateOutputInformation method so that filters down stream know the size of the vectors and other information. Added GenerateOutputInformation method to call parent and set the vector length. Added MakeOutput method to generate posteriors image. Changed AllocateOutputs to only set buffered region and call allocate.

        BUG: Do not copy permissions of files when making the copy in an install rule. If the source file was read-only, this prevents the subsequent set of the destination file's modification time, making the copied file always different in time-stamp than the original and always installing a new file with a new time stamp (but the same content) causing unnecessary downstream incremental rebuilds. As part of this fix, add an optional copyPermissions parameter to the SystemTools routines CopyFileIfDifferent, CopyFileAlways, CopyAFile and CopyADirectory. The copyPermissions parameter defaults to true to preserve the behavior of these routines for existing callers.

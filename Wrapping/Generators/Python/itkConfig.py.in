"""Insight Toolkit (itk) configuration module.

This module contains user options and paths to libraries and language support
files used internally.

User options can be set by importing itkConfig and changing the option values.

Currently-supported options are:
  DebugLevel: must be one of SILENT, WARN, or ERROR (these values are defined
    in itkConfig). Default is WARN.
  ImportCallback: importing itk libraries can take a while. ImportCallback will
    be called when each new library is imported in the import process.
    ImportCallback must be a function that takes two parameters: the name of
    the library being imported, and a float (between 0 and 1) reflecting the
    fraction of the import that is completed.
  LazyLoading: Only load an itk library when needed. Before the library is
    loaded, the namespace will be inhabited with dummy objects."""

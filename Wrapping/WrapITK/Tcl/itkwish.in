# This is a shell script driving the ITK Tcl wrapper executable.  It
# sets up the environment and then executes the real executable.
# Alternatively, if the first command line argument is "--run", the rest
# of the command line will be invoked as a command in the proper
# environment.
#
# The real executable is located relative to this script in
#   ../lib/InsightToolkit

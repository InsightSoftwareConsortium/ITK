 *
 * Use the functions in this module to manage HDF5 objects.
 *
 * HDF5 objects (groups, datasets, datatype objects) are usually created
 * using functions in the object-specific modules (\ref H5G, \ref H5D,
 * \ref H5T). However, new objects can also be created by copying existing
 * objects.
 *
 * Many functions in this module are variations on object introspection,
 * that is, the retrieval of detailed information about HDF5 objects in a file.
 * Objects in an HDF5 file can be "visited" in an iterative fashion.
 *
 * HDF5 objects are usually updated using functions in the object-specific
 * modules. However, there are certain generic object properties, such as
 * reference counts, that can be manipulated using functions in this module.
 *
 * HDF5 objects are deleted as a side effect of rendering them unreachable
 * from the root group. The net effect is the diminution of the object's
 * reference count to zero, which can (but should not usually) be effected
 * by a function in this module.

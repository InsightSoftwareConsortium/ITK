 *
 * Use the functions in this module to manage HDF5 filters.
 *
 * User-defined filters are created by registering a filter descriptor of
 * type #H5Z_class_t with the library.
 *
 * Available filters can be read or examined at runtime.
 *
 * It is conceivable that filters are stateful and that that state be
 * updated at runtime.
 *
 * Filters are deleted by unregistering.
 *

 *
 * HDF5 supports a filter pipeline that provides the capability for standard and
 * customized raw data processing during I/O operations.  HDF5 is distributed
 * with a small set of standard filters such as compression (gzip, SZIP, and a
 * shuffling algorithm) and error checking (Fletcher32 checksum). For further
 * flexibility, the library allows a user application to extend the pipeline
 * through the creation and registration of customized filters.
 *
 * The flexibility of the filter pipeline implementation enables the definition
 * of additional filters by a user application. A filter
 * \li is associated with a dataset when the dataset is created,
 * \li can be used only with chunked data (i.e., datasets stored in the
 *     #H5D_CHUNKED storage layout), and
 * \li is applied independently to each chunk of the dataset.
 *
 * The HDF5 library does not support filters for contiguous datasets because of
 * the difficulty of implementing random access for partial I/O. Compact dataset
 * filters are not supported because it would not produce significant results.
 *
 * Filter identifiers for the filters distributed with the HDF5
 * Library are as follows:
 * <table>
 *   <tr><td>#H5Z_FILTER_DEFLATE</td><td>The gzip compression, or
 *           deflation, filter</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>#H5Z_FILTER_SZIP</td><td>The SZIP compression
 *           filter</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>#H5Z_FILTER_NBIT</td><td>The N-bit compression
 *           filter</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>#H5Z_FILTER_SCALEOFFSET</td><td>The scale-offset
 *           compression filter</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>#H5Z_FILTER_SHUFFLE</td><td>The shuffle algorithm
 *           filter</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>#H5Z_FILTER_FLETCHER32</td><td>The Fletcher32 checksum,
 *           or error checking, filter</td></tr>
 * </table>
 * Custom filters that have been registered with the library will have
 * additional unique identifiers.
 *
 * See \ref_dld_filters for more information on how an HDF5 application can
 * apply a filter that is not registered with the HDF5 library.

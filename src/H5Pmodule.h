 *
 * Use the functions in this module to manage HDF5 property lists and property
 * list classes. HDF5 property lists are the main vehicle to configure the
 * behavior of HDF5 API functions.
 *
 * Typically, property lists are created by instantiating one of the built-in
 * or user-defined property list classes. After adding suitable properties,
 * property lists are used when opening or creating HDF5 items, or when reading
 * or writing data. Property lists can be modified by adding or changing
 * properties. Property lists are deleted by closing the associated handles.

 * \defgroup ALCAPL Attribute and Link Creation Properties
 * \ingroup H5P
 * Currently, there are only two creation properties that you can use to control
 * the creation of HDF5 attributes and links. The first creation property, the
 * choice of a character encoding, applies to both attributes and links.
 * The second creation property applies to links only, and advises the library
 * to automatically create missing intermediate groups when creating new objects.
 *
 * \defgroup DAPL Dataset Access Properties
 * \ingroup H5P
 * Use dataset access properties to modify the default behavior of the HDF5
 * library when accessing datasets. The properties include adjusting the size
 * of the chunk cache, providing prefixes for external content and virtual
 * dataset file paths, and controlling flush behavior, etc. These properties
 * are \Emph{not} persisted with datasets, and can be adjusted at runtime before
 * a dataset is created or opened.
 *
 * \defgroup DCPL Dataset Creation Properties
 * \ingroup H5P
 * Use dataset creation properties to control aspects of dataset creation such
 * as fill time, storage layout, compression methods, etc.
 * Unlike dataset access and transfer properties, creation properties \Emph{are}
 * stored with the dataset, and cannot be changed once a dataset has been
 * created.
 *
 * \defgroup DXPL Dataset Transfer Properties
 * \ingroup H5P
 * Use dataset transfer properties to customize certain aspects of reading
 * and writing datasets such as transformations, MPI-IO I/O mode, error
 * detection, etc. These properties are \Emph{not} persisted with datasets,
 * and can be adjusted at runtime before a dataset is read or written.
 *
 * \defgroup FAPL File Access Properties
 * \ingroup H5P
 * Use file access properties to modify the default behavior of the HDF5
 * library when accessing files. The properties include selecting a virtual
 * file driver (VFD), configuring the metadata cache (MDC), control
 * file locking, etc. These properties are \Emph{not} persisted with files, and
 * can be adjusted at runtime before a file is created or opened.
 *
 * \defgroup FCPL File Creation Properties
 * \ingroup H5P
 * Use file creation properties to control aspects of file creation such
 * as setting a file space management strategy or creating a user block.
 * Unlike file access properties, creation properties \Emph{are}
 * stored with the file, and cannot be changed once a file has been
 * created.
 *

 * \ingroup H5P
 * \todo Should this be as standalone page?
 *
 * \defgroup GCPL Group Creation Properties
 * \ingroup H5P
 * Use group creation properties to control aspects of group creation such
 * as storage layout, compression, and link creation order tracking.
 * Unlike file access properties, creation properties \Emph{are}
 * stored with the group, and cannot be changed once a group has been
 * created.

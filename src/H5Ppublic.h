 * \details H5Pcreate_class() registers a new property list class with the
 *          library. The new property list class can inherit from an
 *          existing property list class, \p parent, or may be derived
 *          from the default “empty” class, NULL. New classes with
 *          inherited properties from existing classes may not remove
 *          those existing properties, only add or remove their own class
 *          properties. Property list classes defined and supported in the
 *          HDF5 library distribution are listed and briefly described in
 *          H5Pcreate(). The \p create routine is called when a new property
 *          list of this class is being created. The #H5P_cls_create_func_t
 *          callback function is defined as follows:

 *          </table>
 *
 *          The \p create routine is called after any registered
 *          \p create function is called for each property value. If the
 *          \p create routine returns a negative value, the new list is not
 *          returned to the user and the property list creation routine returns
 *          an error value.
 *
 *          The \p copy routine is called when an existing property
 *          list of this class is copied. The #H5P_cls_copy_func_t callback

 *          The \p copy routine is called after any registered \p copy function

 *          negative value, the new list is not returned to the user and the
 *          property list \p copy routine returns an error value.
 *
 *           The \p close routine is called when a property list of this class
 *           is being closed. The #H5P_cls_close_func_t callback function is
 *           defined as follows:

 *
 *          The \p copy routine is called when a new property list with

 *          routine returns an error value.
 *
 *          The \p compare routine is called when a property list with this
 *          property is compared to another property list with the same

 *
 *          The \p compare routine may not modify the values. The \p compare

 *       of the fractal heap for groups in the order in which they were
 *       set.
 *
 * \note Filters can be applied only to chunked datasets; they cannot be
 *       used with other dataset storage methods, such as contiguous,
 *       compact, or external datasets.
 *
 * \note Dataset elements of variable-length and dataset region
 *       reference datatypes are stored in separate structures in the
 *       file called heaps. Filters cannot currently be applied to
 *       these heaps.
 *
 * \note <b>Filter Behavior in HDF5:</b><br />
 *       Filters can be inserted into the HDF5 pipeline to perform
 *       functions such as compression and conversion. As such, they are
 *       a very flexible aspect of HDF5; for example, a user-defined
 *       filter could provide encryption for an HDF5 dataset.
 *
 * \note A filter can be declared as either required or optional.
 *       Required is the default status; optional status must be
 *       explicitly declared.
 *
 * \note A required filter that fails or is not defined causes an
 *       entire output operation to fail; if it was applied when the
 *       data was written, such a filter will cause an input operation
 *       to fail.
 *
 * \note The following table summarizes required filter behavior.
 *          <table>
 *           <tr>
 *            <th></th>
 *            <th>Required FILTER_X not available</th>
 *            <th>FILTER_X available</th>
 *           </tr>
 *           <tr>
 *            <td>H5Pset_<FILTER_X></td>
 *            <td>Will fail.</td>
 *            <td>Will succeed.</td>
 *           </tr>
 *           <tr>
 *            <td>H5Dwrite with FILTER_X set</td>
 *            <td>Will fail.</td>
 *            <td>Will succeed; FILTER_X will be applied to
 *                the data.</td>
 *           </tr>
 *           <tr>
 *            <td>H5Dread with FILTER_X set</td>
 *            <td>Will fail.</td>
 *            <td>Will succeed.</td>
 *           </tr>
 *          </table>
 * \note An optional filter can be set for an HDF5 dataset even when
 *       the filter is not available. Such a filter can then be
 *       applied to the dataset when it becomes available on the
 *       original system or when the file containing the dataset is
 *       processed on a system on which it is available.
 *
 * \note A filter can be declared as optional through the use of the
 *       #H5Z_FLAG_OPTIONAL flag with H5Pset_filter().
 *
 * \note Consider a situation where one is creating files that will
 *       normally be used only on systems where the optional (and
 *       fictional) filter FILTER_Z is routinely available. One can
 *       create those files on system A, which lacks FILTER_Z, create
 *       chunked datasets in the files with FILTER_Z defined in the
 *       dataset creation property list, and even write data to those
 *       datasets. The dataset object header will indicate that FILTER_Z
 *       has been associated with this dataset. But since system A does
 *       not have FILTER_Z, dataset chunks will be written without it
 *       being applied.
 *
 * \note HDF5 has a mechanism for determining whether chunks are
 *       actually written with the filters specified in the object
 *       header, so while the filter remains unavailable, system A will
 *       be able to read the data. Once the file is moved to system B,
 *       where FILTER_Z is available, HDF5 will apply FILTER_Z to any
 *       data rewritten or new data written in these datasets. Dataset
 *       chunks that have been written on system B will then be
 *       unreadable on system A; chunks that have not been re-written
 *       since being written on system A will remain readable on system
 *       A. All chunks will be readable on system B.
 *
 * \note The following table summarizes optional filter behavior.
 *          <table>
 *           <tr>
 *            <th></th>
 *            <th>FILTER_Z not available</th>

 * \note The above principles apply generally in the use of HDF5
 *       optional filters insofar as HDF5 does as much as possible to
 *       complete an operation when an optional filter is unavailable.
 *       (The SZIP filter is an exception to this rule; see H5Pset_szip()

 *
 * \attention The Fletcher32 EDC checksum filter was added in HDF5 Release
 *            1.6.0. In the original implementation, however, the checksum
 *            value was calculated incorrectly on little-endian systems.
 *            The error was fixed in HDF5 Release 1.6.3.
 *
 * \attention As a result of this fix, an HDF5 library of Release 1.6.0
 *            through Release 1.6.2 cannot read a dataset created or written
 *            with Release 1.6.3 or later if the dataset was created with
 *            the checksum filter and the filter is enabled in the reading
 *            library. (Libraries of Release 1.6.3 and later understand the
 *            earlier error and compensate appropriately.)
 *
 * \attention \b Work-around: An HDF5 library of Release 1.6.2 or earlier
 *            will be able to read a dataset created or written with the
 *            checksum filter by an HDF5 library of Release 1.6.3 or later
 *            if the checksum filter is disabled for the read operation.
 *            This can be accomplished via a call to H5Pset_edc_check()
 *            with the value #H5Z_DISABLE_EDC in the second parameter.
 *            This has the obvious drawback that the application will be

 *          not be confused with user metadata, which consists of attributes
 *          created by users and attached to HDF5 objects such as datasets via
 *          \ref H5A API calls.
 *
 *          Due to the complexity of the cache, a trace/logging feature has been
 *          created that can be used by HDF5 developers for debugging and
 *          performance analysis. The functions that control this functionality
 *          will normally be of use to a very limited number of developers
 *          outside of The HDF Group. The functions have been documented to help
 *          users create logs that can be sent with bug reports.
 *
 *          Control of the log functionality is straightforward. Logging is
 *          enabled via the H5Pset_mdc_log_options() function, which will modify
 *          the file access property list used to open or create a file. This
 *          function has a flag that determines whether logging begins at file
 *          open or starts in a paused state. Log messages can then be
 *          controlled via the H5Fstart_mdc_logging() / H5Fstop_mdc_logging()

 *
 * \note Optimum chunk cache parameters may vary widely depending

 *       in read/write mode; see H5Pset_fapl_mpio() and

 *
 * \note Raw dataset chunk caching is supported when these drivers are

 *         **Failure Modes**: Due to interactions between this function and

 *
 * \details H5Pset_file_image_callbacks() sets callback functions for working
 *          with file images in memory.
 *
 *          H5Pset_file_image_callbacks() allows an application to control the
 *          management of file image buffers through user defined callbacks.
 *          These callbacks can be used in the management of file image buffers
 *          in property lists and with certain file drivers.
 *
 *          H5Pset_file_image_callbacks() must be used before any file image has
 *          been set in the file access property list. Once a file image has
 *          been set, the function will fail.
 *
 *          The callback routines set up by H5Pset_file_image_callbacks() are
 *          invoked when a new file image buffer is allocated, when an existing
 *          file image buffer is copied or resized, or when a file image buffer
 *          is released from use.
 *
 *          Some file drivers allow the use of user-defined callback functions
 *          for allocating, freeing, and copying the driver’s internal buffer,
 *          potentially allowing optimizations such as avoiding large \c malloc
 *          and \c memcpy operations, or to perform detailed logging.
 *
 *          From the perspective of the HDF5 library, the operations of the
 *          \ref H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t.image_malloc "image_malloc",
 *          \ref H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t.image_memcpy "image_memcpy",
 *          \ref H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t.image_realloc "image_realloc", and
 *          \ref H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t.image_free "image_free" callbacks
 *          must be identical to those of the
 *          corresponding C standard library calls (\c malloc, \c memcpy,
 *          \c realloc, and \c free). While the operations must be identical,
 *          the file image callbacks have more parameters. The return values
 *          of \ref H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t.image_malloc "image_malloc" and
 *          \ref H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t.image_realloc "image_realloc" are identical to
 *          the return values of \c malloc and \c realloc. The return values of
 *          \ref H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t.image_malloc "image_malloc" and
 *          \ref H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t.image_free "image_free" differ from the return
 *          values of \c memcpy and \c free in that the return values of
 *          \ref H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t.image_memcpy "image_memcpy" and
 *          \ref H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t.image_free "image_free" can also indicate failure.
 *
 *          The callbacks and their parameters, along with a struct and
 *          an \c ENUM required for their use, are described below.
 *
 *          <b>Callback struct and \c ENUM:</b>
 *
 *          The callback functions set up by H5Pset_file_image_callbacks() use
 *          a struct and an \c ENUM that are defined as follows
 *
 *          The struct #H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t serves as a container
 *          for the callback functions and a pointer to user-supplied data.
 *          The struct is defined as follows:
 *          \snippet H5FDpublic.h H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t_snip
 *
 *          Elements of the #H5FD_file_image_op_t are used by the
 *          callbacks to invoke certain operations on file images. The ENUM is
 *          defined as follows:
 *          \snippet H5FDpublic.h H5FD_file_image_op_t_snip
 *
 *          The elements of the #H5FD_file_image_op_t are used in the following
 *          callbacks:
 *
 *          - The \ref H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t.image_malloc "image_malloc" callback
 *          contains a pointer to a function that must appear to HDF5 to have
 *          functionality identical to that of the standard C library \c malloc() call.
 *
 *          - Signature in #H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t:
 *          \snippet H5FDpublic.h image_malloc_snip
 *          \n
 *          - The \ref H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t.image_memcpy "image_memcpy"
 *          callback contains a pointer to a function
 *          that must appear to HDF5 to have functionality identical to that
 *          of the standard C library \c memcopy() call, except that it returns
 *          a \p NULL on failure. (The \c memcpy C Library routine is defined
 *          to return the \p dest parameter in all cases.)
 *
 *          - Setting \ref H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t.image_memcpy "image_memcpy"
 *          to \c NULL indicates that HDF5 should invoke
 *          the standard C library \c memcpy() routine when copying buffers.
 *
 *          - Signature in #H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t:
 *          \snippet H5FDpublic.h image_memcpy_snip
 *          \n
 *          - The \ref H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t.image_realloc "image_realloc" callback
 *          contains a pointer to a function that must appear to HDF5 to have
 *          functionality identical to that of the standard C library \c realloc() call.
 *
 *          - Setting \ref H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t.image_realloc "image_realloc"
 *          to \p NULL indicates that HDF5 should
 *          invoke the standard C library \c realloc() routine when resizing
 *          file image buffers.
 *
 *          - Signature in #H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t:
 *          \snippet H5FDpublic.h image_realloc_snip
 *          \n
 *          - The \ref H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t.image_free "image_free" callback contains
 *          a pointer to a function that must appear to HDF5 to have functionality
 *          identical to that of the standard C library \c free() call, except
 *          that it will return \c 0 (\c SUCCEED) on success and \c -1 (\c FAIL) on failure.
 *
 *          - Setting \ref H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t.image_free "image_free"
 *          to \c NULL indicates that HDF5 should invoke
 *          the standard C library \c free() routine when releasing file image
 *          buffers.
 *
 *          - Signature in #H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t:
 *          \snippet H5FDpublic.h image_free_snip
 *          \n
 *          - The  \ref H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t.udata_copy "udata_copy"
 *          callback contains a pointer to a function
 *          that, from the perspective of HDF5, allocates a buffer of suitable
 *          size, copies the contents of the supplied \p udata into the new
 *          buffer, and returns the address of the new buffer. The function
 *          returns NULL on failure. This function is necessary if a non-NULL
 *          \p udata parameter is supplied, so that property lists containing
 *          the image callbacks can be copied. If the \p udata parameter below
 *          is \c NULL, then this parameter should be \c NULL as well.
 *
 *          - Signature in #H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t:
 *          \snippet H5FDpublic.h udata_copy_snip
 *          \n
 *          - The \ref H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t.udata_free "udata_free"
 *          callback contains a pointer to a function
 *          that, from the perspective of HDF5, frees a user data block. This
 *          function is necessary if a non-NULL udata parameter is supplied so
 *          that property lists containing image callbacks can be discarded
 *          without a memory leak. If the udata parameter below is \c NULL,
 *          this parameter should be \c NULL as well.
 *
 *          - Signature in #H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t:
 *          \snippet H5FDpublic.h udata_free_snip
 *
 *          - \p **udata**, the final field in the #H5FD_file_image_callbacks_t
 *          struct, provides a pointer to user-defined data. This pointer will
 *          be passed to the

 *          is normally invisible to the user and is used by the library for
 *          purposes such as locating and indexing data. File metadata should
 *          not be confused with user metadata, which consists of attributes
 *          created by users and attached to HDF5 objects such as datasets via
 *          H5A API calls.
 *
 *          Due to the complexity of the cache, a trace/logging feature has
 *          been created that can be used by HDF5 developers for debugging and
 *          performance analysis. The functions that control this functionality
 *          will normally be of use to a very limited number of developers
 *          outside of The HDF Group. The functions have been documented to
 *          help users create logs that can be sent with bug reports.
 *
 *          Control of the log functionality is straightforward. Logging is
 *          enabled via the H5Pset_mdc_log_options() function,
 *          which will modify the file access property list used to open or
 *          create a file. This function has a flag that determines whether
 *          logging begins at file open or starts in a paused state. Log
 *          messages can then be controlled via the H5Fstart_mdc_logging()
 *          and H5Fstop_mdc_logging() function.
 *
 *          H5Pget_mdc_log_options() can be used to examine a file access
 *          property list, and H5Fget_mdc_logging_status() will return the
 *          current state of the logging flags.
 *
 *          The log format is described in [<em>Metadata Cache Logging</em>]

 *          checksum computed for the metadata just read with the checksum stored within
 *          the piece of checksum. When performing SWMR operations on a file, the
 *          checksum check might fail when the library reads data on a system that is not

 *
 *          The number of read attempts used by the library will depend on how the file is

 *          - For a file opened with SWMR access:
 *            - If the user sets the number of attempts to \Code{N}, the library will use \Code{N}.
 *            - If the user does not set the number of attempts, the library will use the
 *              default for SWMR access (\Code{100}).
 *          - For a file opened with non-SWMR access, the library will always use the default
 *            for non-SWMR access (\Code{1}). The value set via this routine does not have any effect
 *            during non-SWMR access.

 *          collectively; if \p is_collective is \Code{0}, such operations may
 *          be performed independently.
 *
 *          Users must be aware that several HDF5 operations can potentially
 *          issue metadata reads. These include opening a dataset, datatype, or
 *          group; reading an attribute; or issuing a \Emph{get info} call such
 *          as getting information for a group with H5Fget_info(). Collective
 *          I/O requirements must be kept in mind when issuing such calls in the
 *          context of parallel I/O.
 *
 *          If this property is collective on a file access property list that
 *          is used in creating or opening a file, then the HDF5 library will
 *          assume that all metadata read operations issued on that file
 *          identifier will be issued collectively from all ranks irrespective
 *          of the individual setting of a particular operation. If this
 *          assumption is not adhered to, corruption will be introduced in the
 *          metadata cache and HDF5’s behavior will be undefined.
 *
 *          Alternatively, a user may wish to avoid setting this property
 *          globally on the file access property list, and individually set it
 *          on particular object access property lists (dataset, group, link,
 *          datatype, attribute access property lists) for certain operations.
 *          This will indicate that only the operations issued with such an
 *          access property list will be called collectively and other
 *          operations may potentially be called independently. There are,
 *          however, several HDF5 operations that can issue metadata reads but
 *          have no property list in their function signatures to allow passing
 *          the collective requirement property. For those operations, the only
 *          option is to set the global collective requirement property on the
 *          file access property list; otherwise the metadata reads that can be
 *          triggered from those operations will be done independently by each
 *          process.
 *
 *          Functions that do not accommodate an access property list but that
 *          might issue metadata reads are listed in \ref maybe_metadata_reads.
 *
 * \attention As noted above, corruption will be introduced into the metadata
 *            cache and HDF5 library behavior will be undefined when both of the following

 *              - A file is created or opened with a file access property list in which the

 *              - Any function is called that triggers an independent metadata read while the

 *
 * \par Limitations: While it is an obvious error to request a cache image when
 *      opening the file read only, it is not in general possible to test for
 *      this error in the H5Pset_mdc_image_config() call. Rather than fail the
 *      subsequent file open, the library silently ignores the file image
 *      request in this case.\n It is also an error to request a cache image on
 *      a file that does not support superblock extension messages (i.e. a
 *      superblock version less than 2). As above, it is not always possible to
 *      detect this error in the H5Pset_mdc_image_config() call, and thus the
 *      request for a cache image will fail silently in this case as well.\n
 *      Creation of cache images is currently disabled in parallel -- as above,
 *      any request for a cache image in this context will fail silently.\n
 *      Files with cache images may be read in parallel applications, but note
 *      that the load of the cache image is a collective operation triggered by
 *      the first operation that accesses metadata after file open (or, if
 *      persistent free space managers are enabled, on the first allocation or
 *      deallocation of file space, or read of file space manager status,
 *      whichever comes first). Thus the parallel process may deadlock if any
 *      process does not participate in this access.\n
 *      In long sequences of file  closes and opens, infrequently accessed
 *      metadata can accumulate in the cache image to the point where the cost
 *      of storing and restoring this metadata exceeds the benefit of retaining
 *      frequently used metadata in the cache image. When implemented, the
 *      #H5AC_cache_image_config_t::entry_ageout should address this problem. In
 *      the interim, not requesting a cache image every n file close/open cycles
 *      may be an acceptable work around. The choice of \c n will be driven by
 *      application behavior, but \Code{n = 10} seems a good starting point.

 *          When data of the above datatype is stored on disk using the

 *          </tr>
 *          </table>
 *          The N-Bit filter is used effectively for compressing data of
 *          an N-Bit datatype as well as a compound and an array
 *          datatype with N-Bit fields. However, the datatype classes of
 *          the N-Bit datatype or the N-Bit field of the compound
 *          datatype or the array datatype are limited to integer or
 *          floating-point.
 *
 *          The N-Bit filter supports complex situations where a compound
 *          datatype contains member(s) of a compound datatype or an array
 *          datatype that has a compound datatype as the base type.
 *          However, it does not support the situation where an array
 *          datatype has a variable-length or variable-length string as
 *          its base datatype. The filter does support the situation where
 *          a variable-length or variable-length string is a member of a
 *          compound datatype.
 *
 *          The N-Bit filter allows all other HDF5 datatypes (such as
 *          time, string, bitfield, opaque, reference, enum, and variable
 *          length) to pass through as a no-op.
 *
 *          Like other I/O filters supported by the HDF5 library,
 *          application using the N-Bit filter must store data with
 *          chunked storage.
 *
 *          By nature, the N-Bit filter should not be used together with
 *          other I/O filters.

 * \details H5Pset_scaleoffset() sets the scale-offset filter,
 *          #H5Z_FILTER_SCALEOFFSET, for a dataset.
 *
 *          Generally speaking, scale-offset compression performs a scale and/or
 *          offset operation on each data value and truncates the resulting
 *          value to a minimum number of bits (MinBits) before storing it. The
 *          current scale-offset filter supports integer and floating-point
 *          datatypes.
 *
 *          For an integer datatype, the parameter \p scale_type should be set
 *          to #H5Z_SO_INT (2). The parameter \p scale_factor denotes MinBits.
 *          If the user sets it to H5Z_SO_INT_MINBITS_DEFAULT (0), the filter
 *          will calculate MinBits. If \p scale_factor is set to a positive
 *          integer, the filter does not do any calculation and just uses the
 *          number as MinBits. However, if the user gives a MinBits that is less
 *          than what would be generated by the filter, the compression will be
 *          lossy. Also, the MinBits supplied by the user cannot exceed the
 *          number of bits to store one value of the dataset datatype.
 *
 *          For a floating-point datatype, the filter adopts the GRiB data
 *          packing mechanism, which offers two alternate methods: E-scaling and
 *          D-scaling. Both methods are lossy compression. If the parameter
 *          \p scale_type is set to #H5Z_SO_FLOAT_DSCALE (0), the filter will
 *          use the D-scaling method; if it is set to #H5Z_SO_FLOAT_ESCALE (1),
 *          the filter will use the E-scaling method. Since only the D-scaling
 *          method is implemented, \p scale_type should be set to
 *          #H5Z_SO_FLOAT_DSCALE or 0.
 *
 *          When the D-scaling method is used, the original data is "D" scaled
 *          — multiplied by 10 to the power of \p scale_factor, and the
 *          "significant" part of the value is moved to the left of the decimal
 *          point. Care should be taken in setting the decimal \p scale_factor
 *          so that the integer part will have enough precision to contain the
 *          appropriate information of the data value. For example, if
 *          \p scale_factor is set to 2, the number 104.561 will be 10456.1
 *          after "D" scaling. The last digit 1 is not "significant" and is
 *          thrown off in the process of rounding. The user should make sure that
 *          after "D" scaling and rounding, the data values are within the range
 *          that can be represented by the integer (same size as the
 *          floating-point type).
 *
 *          Valid values for scale_type are as follows:
 *
 *          <table>
 *          <tr>
 *            <td>#H5Z_SO_FLOAT_DSCALE (0)</td>

 *          for a dataset. SZIP is a compression method designed for use with
 *          scientific data.
 *
 *          Before proceeding, all users should review the “Limitations”
 *          section below.
 *
 *          Users familiar with SZIP outside the HDF5 context may benefit
 *          from reviewing the Note “For Users Familiar with SZIP in Other
 *          Contexts” below.
 *
 *          In the text below, the term pixel refers to an HDF5 data element.
 *          This terminology derives from SZIP compression's use with image
 *          data, where pixel referred to an image pixel.
 *
 *          The SZIP \p bits_per_pixel value (see Note, below) is automatically
 *          set, based on the HDF5 datatype. SZIP can be used with atomic
 *          datatypes that may have size of 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits.
 *          Specifically, a dataset with a datatype that is 8-, 16-, 32-, or
 *          64-bit signed or unsigned integer; char; or 32- or 64-bit float
 *          can be compressed with SZIP. See Note, below, for further
 *          discussion of the the SZIP \p bits_per_pixel setting.
 *
 *          SZIP options are passed in an options mask, \p options_mask,
 *          as follows.
 *
 *          <table>
 *            <tr>
 *             <th>Option</th>
 *             <th>Description (Mutually exclusive; select one.)</th>
 *            </tr>
 *            <tr>
 *             <td>#H5_SZIP_EC_OPTION_MASK</td>
 *             <td>Selects entropy coding method</td>
 *            </tr>
 *            <tr>
 *             <td>#H5_SZIP_NN_OPTION_MASK</td>
 *             <td>Selects nearest neighbor coding method</td>
 *            </tr>
 *           </table>
 *
 *           The following guidelines can be used in determining which
 *           option to select:
 *
 *           - The entropy coding method, the EC option specified by
 *             #H5_SZIP_EC_OPTION_MASK, is best suited for data that has been
 *             processed. The EC method works best for small numbers.
 *           - The nearest neighbor coding method, the NN option specified
 *             by #H5_SZIP_NN_OPTION_MASK, preprocesses the data then the
 *             applies EC method as above.
 *
 *           Other factors may affect results, but the above criteria
 *           provides a good starting point for optimizing data compression.
 *
 *           SZIP compresses data block by block, with a user-tunable block
 *           size. This block size is passed in the parameter
 *           \p pixels_per_block and must be even and not greater than 32,
 *           with typical values being 8, 10, 16, or 32. This parameter
 *           affects compression ratio; the more pixel values vary, the
 *           smaller this number should be to achieve better performance.
 *
 *           In HDF5, compression can be applied only to chunked datasets.
 *           If \p pixels_per_block is bigger than the total number of
 *           elements in a dataset chunk, H5Pset_szip() will succeed but
 *           the subsequent call to H5Dcreate() will fail; the conflict
 *           can be detected only when the property list is used.
 *
 *           To achieve optimal performance for SZIP compression, it is
 *           recommended that a chunk's fastest-changing dimension be equal
 *           to N times \p pixels_per_block where N is the maximum number of
 *           blocks per scan line allowed by the SZIP library. In the
 *           current version of SZIP, N is set to 128.
 *
 *           SZIP compression is an optional HDF5 filter.
 *
 *           \b Limitations:
 *
 *           - SZIP compression cannot be applied to compound, array,
 *             variable-length, enumeration, or any other user-defined
 *             datatypes. If an SZIP filter is set in a dataset creation
 *             property list used to create a dataset containing a
 *             non-allowed datatype, the call to H5Dcreate() will fail; the
 *             conflict can be detected only when the property list is used.
 *           - Users should be aware that there are factors that affect one’s
 *             rights and ability to use SZIP compression by reviewing the
 *             SZIP copyright notice.
 *
 * \note \b For \b Users \b Familiar \b with \b SZIP \b in \b Other \b Contexts:
 *
 * \note  The following notes are of interest primarily to those who have
 *        used SZIP compression outside of the HDF5 context.
 *        In non-HDF5 applications, SZIP typically requires that the user
 *        application supply additional parameters:
 *        - \p pixels_in_object, the number of pixels in the object to
 *          be compressed
 *        - \p bits_per_pixel, the number of bits per pixel
 *        - \p pixels_per_scanline, the number of pixels per scan line
 *
 * \note  These values need not be independently supplied in the HDF5
 *        environment as they are derived from the datatype and dataspace,
 *        which are already known. In particular, HDF5 sets
 *        \p pixels_in_object to the number of elements in a chunk and
 *        \p bits_per_pixel to the size of the element or pixel datatype.
 *
 * \note  The following algorithm is used to set \p pixels_per_scanline:
 *        - If the size of a chunk's fastest-changing dimension, size,
 *          is greater than 4K, set \p pixels_per_scanline to 128 times
 *          \p pixels_per_block.
 *        - If size is less than 4K but greater than \p pixels_per_block,
 *          set \p pixels_per_scanline to the minimum of size and 128
 *          times \p pixels_per_block.
 *        - If size is less than \p pixels_per_block but greater than the
 *          number elements in the chunk, set \p pixels_per_scanline to
 *          the minimum of the number elements in the chunk and 128 times
 *          \p pixels_per_block.
 *
 * \note  The HDF5 datatype may have precision that is less than the full
 *        size of the data element, e.g., an 11-bit integer can be defined
 *        using H5Tset_precision(). To a certain extent, SZIP can take
 *        advantage of the precision of the datatype to improve compression:
 *        - If the HDF5 datatype size is 24-bit or less and the offset of
 *          the bits in the HDF5 datatype is zero (see H5Tset_offset() or
 *          H5Tget_offset()), the data is the in lowest N bits of the data
 *          element. In this case, the SZIP \p bits_per_pixel is set to the
 *          precision of the HDF5 datatype.
 *        - If the offset is not zero, the SZIP \p bits_per_pixel will be
 *          set to the number of bits in the full size of the data element.
 *        - If the HDF5 datatype precision is 25-bit to 32-bit, the SZIP
 *          \p bits_per_pixel will be set to 32.
 *        - If the HDF5 datatype precision is 33-bit to 64-bit, the SZIP
 *          \p bits_per_pixel will be set to 64.
 *
 * \note HDF5 always modifies the options mask provided by the user to set up
 *       usage of RAW_OPTION_MASK, ALLOW_K13_OPTION_MASK, and one of
 *       LSB_OPTION_MASK or MSB_OPTION_MASK, depending on endianness of the
 *       datatype.

 *          is available in the "Examples of Source to Virtual Dataset Mapping"
 *          chapter in the
 *          <a href="https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/RFC+HDF5+Virtual+Dataset">

 *      </table>
 *      If the printf form is used for the source file or dataset names, the
 *      selection in the source dataset’s dataspace must be fixed-size.
 *
 * \par Source File Resolutions:
 *      When a source dataset residing in a different file is accessed, the
 *      library will search for the source file \p src_file_name as described
 *      below:
 *      \li If \p src_file_name is a \Code{"."} (period) then it refers to the
 *          file containing the virtual dataset.
 *      \li If \p src_file_name is a relative pathname, the following steps are
 *          performed:
 *          - The library will get the prefix(es) set in the environment
 *            variable \c HDF5_VDS_PREFIX and will try to prepend each prefix
 *            to \p src_file_name to form a new \p src_file_name. If the new
 *            \p src_file_name does not exist or if \c HDF5_VDS_PREFIX is not
 *            set, the library will get the prefix set via H5Pset_virtual_prefix()
 *            and prepend it to \p src_file_name to form a new \p src_file_name.
 *            If the new \p src_file_name does not exist or no prefix is being
 *            set by H5Pset_virtual_prefix() then the path of the file containing
 *            the virtual dataset is obtained. This path can be the absolute path
 *            or the current working directory plus the relative path of that
 *            file when it is created/opened. The library will prepend this path
 *            to \p src_file_name to form a new \p src_file_name.
 *          - If the new \p src_file_name does not exist, then the library will
 *            look for \p src_file_name and will return failure/success accordingly.
 *      \li If \p src_file_name is an absolute pathname, the library will first
 *          try to find \p src_file_name. If \p src_file_name does not exist,
 *          \p src_file_name is stripped of directory paths to form a new
 *          \p src_file_name. The search for the new \p src_file_name then follows
 *          the same steps as described above for a relative pathname. See
 *          examples below illustrating how \p src_file_name is stripped to form
 *          a new \p src_file_name.
 * \par
 *      Note that \p src_file_name is considered to be an absolute pathname when
 *      the following condition is true:
 *      \li For Unix, the first character of \p src_file_name is a slash
 *          (\Code{/}).\n For example, consider a \p src_file_name of
 *          \Code{/tmp/A.h5}. If that source file does not exist, the new
 *          \p src_file_name after stripping will be \Code{A.h5}.
 *      \li For Windows, there are 6 cases:
 *          1. \p src_file_name is an absolute drive with absolute pathname.\n
 *             For example, consider a \p src_file_name of \Code{/tmp/A.h5}.

 *             \p src_file_name after stripping will be \Code{A.h5}.
 *          3. \p src_file_name is an absolute drive with relative pathname.\n
 *             For example, consider a \p src_file_name of \Code{/tmp/A.h5}.
 *             If that source file does not exist, the new \p src_file_name
 *             after stripping will be \Code{tmp/A.h5}.
 *          4. \p src_file_name is in UNC (Uniform Naming Convention) format
 *             with server name, share name, and pathname.\n
 *             For example, consider a \p src_file_name of \Code{/tmp/A.h5}.

 *             format with server name, share name, and pathname.\n
 *             For example, consider a \p src_file_name of \Code{/tmp/A.h5}.
 *             If that source file does not exist, the new \p src_file_name

 *          actions above are not invoked.
 *
 *          The specified boundary is indicated by the parameter
 *          \p boundary. It is a 1-dimensional array with \p ndims
 *          elements, which should be the same as the rank of the
 *          dataset’s dataspace. While appending to a dataset along a

 *          determines a boundary is reached when the resulting dimension
 *          size is divisible by \p boundary[index]. A zero value for
 *          \p boundary[index] indicates no boundary is set for that
 *          dimension index.
 *
 *          The setting of this property will apply only for a chunked
 *          dataset with an extendible dataspace. A dataspace is extendible
 *          when it is defined with either one of the following:
 *
 *          \li A dataspace with fixed current and maximum dimension sizes
 *          \li A dataspace with at least one unlimited dimension for its
 *              maximum dimension size
 *
 *          When creating or opening a chunked dataset, the library will
 *          check whether the boundary as specified in the access property
 *          list is set up properly. The library will fail the dataset
 *          create or open if the following conditions are true:
 *
 *          \li \p ndims, the number of elements for boundary, is not the
 *              same as the rank of the dataset’s dataspace.
 *          \li A non-zero boundary value is specified for a non-extendible

 * \details H5Pset_chunk_cache() sets the number of elements, the total

 *          data chunk cache on a dataset access property list. After
 *          calling this function, the values set in the property list
 *          will override the values in the file's file access property
 *          list.
 *
 *          The raw data chunk cache inserts chunks into the cache
 *          by first computing a hash value using the address of a chunk,
 *          then using that hash value as the chunk's index into the table
 *          of cached chunks. The size of this hash table, i.e., and the
 *          number of possible hash values, is determined by the
 *          \p rdcc_nslots parameter. If a different chunk in the cache
 *          has the same hash value, this causes a collision, which
 *          reduces efficiency. If inserting the chunk into cache would
 *          cause the cache to be too big, then the cache is pruned
 *          according to the \p rdcc_w0 parameter.
 *
 *      \b Motivation: H5Pset_chunk_cache() is used to adjust the chunk
 *       cache parameters on a per-dataset basis, as opposed to a global
 *       setting for the file using H5Pset_cache(). The optimum chunk
 *       cache parameters may vary widely with different data layout and
 *       access patterns, so for optimal performance they must be set
 *       individually for each dataset. It may also be beneficial to
 *       reduce the size of the chunk cache for datasets whose
 *       performance is not important in order to save memory space.
 *
 *      \b Example \b Usage: The following code sets the chunk cache to
 *       use a hash table with 12421 elements and a maximum size of
 *       16 MB, while using the preemption policy specified for the
 *       entire file:
 *       \Code{
 *       H5Pset_chunk_cache(dapl_id, 12421, 16*1024*1024,
 *            H5D_CHUNK_CACHE_W0_DEFAULT);}
 *
 *      \b Usage \b Notes: The chunk cache size is a property for
 *       accessing a dataset and is not stored with a dataset or a
 *       file. To guarantee the same chunk cache settings each time
 *       the dataset is opened, call H5Dopen() with a dataset access
 *       property list where the chunk cache size is set by calling
 *       H5Pset_chunk_cache() for that property list. The property
 *       list can be used for multiple accesses in the same
 *       application.
 *
 *       For files where the same chunk cache size will be
 *       appropriate for all or most datasets, H5Pset_cache() can
 *       be called with a file access property list to set the
 *       chunk cache size for accessing all datasets in the file.
 *
 *       Both methods can be used in combination, in which case
 *       the chunk cache size set by H5Pset_cache() will apply
 *       except for specific datasets where H5Dopen() is called
 *       with dataset property list with the chunk cache size
 *       set by H5Pset_chunk_cache().
 *
 *       In the absence of any cache settings, H5Dopen() will
 *       by default create a 1 MB chunk cache for the opened

 *
 * \details H5Pset_efile_prefix() sets the prefix used to locate raw data
 *          files for a dataset that uses external storage. This prefix
 *          can provide either an absolute path or a relative path to the
 *          external files.
 *
 *          H5Pset_efile_prefix() is used in conjunction with
 *          H5Pset_external() to control the behavior of the HDF5 library
 *          when searching for the raw data files associated with a dataset
 *          that uses external storage:
 *
 *          \li The default behavior of the library is to search for the
 *              dataset’s external storage raw data files in the same
 *              directory as the HDF5 file which contains the dataset.
 *          \li If the prefix is set to an absolute path, the target
 *              directory will be searched for the dataset’s external
 *              storage raw data files.
 *          \li If the prefix is set to a relative path, the target
 *              directory, relative to the current working directory, will
 *              be searched for the dataset’s external storage raw data
 *              files.
 *          \li If the prefix is set to a relative path that begins with
 *              the special token ${ORIGIN}, that directory, relative to
 *              the HDF5 file containing the dataset, will be searched for
 *              the dataset’s external storage raw data files.
 *
 *           The HDF5_EXTFILE_PREFIX environment variable can be used to
 *           override the above behavior (the environment variable
 *           supersedes the API call). Setting the variable to a path
 *           string and calling H5Dcreate() or H5Dopen() is the equivalent
 *           of calling H5Pset_efile_prefix() and calling the same create
 *           or open function. The environment variable is checked at the
 *           time of the create or open action and copied so it can be
 *           safely changed after the H5Dcreate() or H5Dopen() call.
 *
 *           Calling H5Pset_efile_prefix() with \p prefix set to NULL or
 *           the empty string returns the search path to the default. The
 *           result would be the same as if H5Pset_efile_prefix() had never
 *           been called.
 *
 * \note If the external file prefix is not an absolute path and the HDF5
 *       file is moved, the external storage files will also need to be
 *       moved so they can be accessed at the new location.
 *
 * \note As stated above, the use of the HDF5_EXTFILE_PREFIX environment
 *       variable overrides any property list setting.
 *       H5Pset_efile_prefix() and H5Pget_efile_prefix(), being property
 *       functions, set and retrieve only the property list setting; they
 *       are unaware of the environment variable.
 *
 * \note On Windows, the prefix must be an ASCII string since the Windows
 *       standard C library’s I/O functions cannot handle UTF-8 file names.

 *

 *           </tr>
 *          </table>
 *
 *          The default behavior is that links are tracked and indexed by

 *          The name is always the primary index for links in a group.
 *
 *          H5Pset_link_creation_order() can be used to set link creation

 *

 *          specified for \p crt_order_flags, then links will be tracked

 * \param[in] size_hint Anticipated maximum size in bytes of local heap
 * \return \herr_t
 *
 * \details H5Pset_local_heap_size_hint() is used with original-style HDF5
 *          groups (see “Motivation” below) to specify the anticipated maximum
 *          local heap size, size_hint, for groups created with the group
 *          creation property list \p plist_id. The HDF5 library then uses \p
 *          size_hint to allocate contiguous local heap space in the file for
 *          each group created with \p plist_id.
 *
 *          For groups with many members or very few members, an appropriate
 *          initial value of \p size_hint would be the anticipated number of
 *          group members times the average length of group member names, plus a
 *          small margin:
 *          \code
 *          size_hint = max_number_of_group_members  *
 *                      (average_length_of_group_member_link_names + 2)
 *          \endcode
 *          If it is known that there will be groups with zero members, the use
 *          of a group creation property list with \p size_hint set to to 1 (one)
 *          will guarantee the smallest possible local heap for each of those groups.
 *
 *          Setting \p size_hint to zero (0) causes the library to make a
 *          reasonable estimate for the default local heap size.
 *
 * \par Motivation:
 *      In situations where backward-compatibility is required, specifically, when
 *      libraries prior to HDF5 Release 1.8.0 may be used to read the file, groups
 *      must be created and maintained in the original style. This is HDF5’s default
 *      behavior. If backward compatibility with pre-1.8.0 libraries is not a concern,
 *      greater efficiencies can be obtained with the new-format compact and indexed
 *      groups. See <a href="https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/Groups">Group
 *      implementations in HDF5</a> in the \ref H5G API introduction (at the bottom).\n
 *      H5Pset_local_heap_size_hint() is useful for tuning file size when files
 *      contain original-style groups with either zero members or very large
 *      numbers of members.\n
 *      The original style of HDF5 groups, the only style available prior to HDF5
 *      Release 1.8.0, was well-suited for moderate-sized groups but was not optimized
 *      for either very small or very large groups. This original style remains the
 *      default, but two new group implementations were introduced in HDF5 Release 1.8.0:
 *      compact groups to accommodate zero to small numbers of members and indexed groups
 *      for thousands or tens of thousands of members ... or millions, if that's what
 *      your application requires.\n
 *      The local heap size hint, \p size_hint, is a performance tuning parameter for
 *      original-style groups. As indicated above, an HDF5 group may have zero, a handful,
 *      or tens of thousands of members. Since the original style of HDF5 groups stores the
 *      metadata for all of these group members in a uniform format in a local heap, the size
 *      of that metadata (and hence, the size of the local heap) can vary wildly from group
 *      to group. To intelligently allocate space and to avoid unnecessary fragmentation of
 *      the local heap, it can be valuable to provide the library with a hint as to the local
 *      heap’s likely eventual size. This can be particularly valuable when it is known that
 *      a group will eventually have a great many members. It can also be useful in conserving
 *      space in a file when it is known that certain groups will never have any members.

 *          set by H5Pset_elink_fapl() and the file access flag set by
 *          H5Pset_elink_acc_flags() are applied, so changes made by this
 *          callback function will take precedence.
 *
 * \attention A file close degree property setting (H5Pset_fclose_degree())
 *            in this callback function or an associated property list will
 *            be ignored. A file opened by means of traversing an external
 *            link is always opened with the weak file close degree
 *            property setting, #H5F_CLOSE_WEAK.
 *
 *       <b>Motivation:</b> H5Pset_elink_cb() is used to specify a
 *       callback function that is executed by the HDF5 library when
 *       traversing an external link. This provides a mechanism to set
 *       specific access permissions, modify the file access property
 *       list, modify the parent or target file, or take any other
 *       user-defined action. This callback function is used in
 *       situations where the HDF5 library's default behavior is not
 *       suitable.
 *
 *       <b>Failure Modes:</b> H5Pset_elink_cb() will fail if the link
 *       access property list identifier, \p lapl_id, is invalid or if
 *       the function pointer, \p func, is NULL.
 *
 *       An invalid function pointer, \p func, will cause a segmentation
 *       fault or other failure when an attempt is subsequently made to
 *       traverse an external link.
 *
 *       <b>Example Usage:</b>
 *       This example defines a callback function that prints the name
 *       of the target file every time an external link is followed, and
 *       sets this callback function on \p lapl_id.

 * \param[in] path     The path to be added
 *
 * \return \herr_t
 *
 * \details H5Padd_merge_committed_dtype_path() adds a path, \p path,
 *          which points to a committed datatype, to the current list of
 *          suggested paths stored in the object copy property list
 *          \p plist_id. The search as described in the next paragraph is
 *          effective only if the #H5O_COPY_MERGE_COMMITTED_DTYPE_FLAG is
 *          enabled in the object copy property list via
 *          H5Pset_copy_object().
 *
 *          When copying a committed datatype, a dataset with a committed
 *          datatype, or an object with an attribute of a committed
 *          datatype, the default behavior of H5Ocopy() is to search for
 *          a matching committed datatype:
 *          <ol>
 *          <li> First search the list of suggested paths in the object
 *               copy property list.</li>
 *          <li> Then, if no match has been found, search all the committed
 *               datatypes in the destination file.
 *          </ol>
 *          The default Step 2 in this search process can be changed by
 *          setting a callback function (see H5Pset_mcdt_search_cb()).
 *
 *          Two datatypes are determined equal if their descriptions are
 *          identical, in a manner similar to H5Tequal(). If either
 *          committed datatype has one or more attributes, then all
 *          attributes must be present in both committed datatypes and they
 *          must be identical. Two attributes are considered identical if
 *          their datatype description, dataspace, and raw data values are
 *          the same. However, if an attribute uses a committed datatype,
 *          that committed datatype’s attributes will not be compared.
 *
 *          If a match is found, H5Ocopy() will perform the following in
 *          the destination file:
 *          \li For a committed datatype, the library will create a hard
 *              link to the found datatype.
 *          \li For a dataset that uses a committed datatype, the library
 *              will modify the copied dataset to use the found committed
 *              datatype as its datatype.
 *          \li For an object with an attribute of a committed datatype,
 *              the library will modify the copied object’s attribute to
 *              use the found committed datatype as its datatype.
 *
 *          If no match is found, H5Ocopy() will perform the following in
 *          the destination file:
 *          \li For a committed datatype, the library will copy it as it
 *              would any other object, creating a named committed
 *              datatype at the destination. That is, the library will
 *              create a committed datatype that is accessible in the
 *              file by a unique path.
 *          \li For a dataset that uses a committed datatype, the
 *              library will copy the datatype as an anonymous
 *              committed datatype and use that as the dataset’s
 *              datatype.
 *          \li For an object with an attribute of a committed datatype,
 *              the library will copy the datatype as an anonymous
 *              committed datatype and use that as the attribute’s
 *              datatype.
 *
 *      \b Motivation: H5Padd_merge_committed_dtype_path() provides a
 *       means to override the default behavior of H5Ocopy() when
 *       #H5O_COPY_MERGE_COMMITTED_DTYPE_FLAG is set in an object
 *       copy property list.
 *       H5Padd_merge_committed_dtype_path() is the mechanism for
 *       suggesting search paths where H5Ocopy() will look for a
 *       matching committed datatype. This can be substantially
 *       faster than the default approach of searching the entire
 *       destination file for a match.
 *
 *       \b Example \b Usage: This example adds two paths to the object
 *          copy property list. H5Ocopy() will search the two suggested
 *          paths for a match before searching all the committed datatypes
 *          in the destination file.

 *       callback to take an additional action before the default search
 *       of all committed datatypes in the destination file or to take an
 *       action that replaces the default search. This mechanism is
 *       intended to improve performance when the global search might
 *       take a long time.
 *
 * \b Example \b Usage: This example defines a callback function in
 * the object copy property list.
 *
 * <pre>
 * static H5O_mcdt_search_ret_t
 * mcdt_search_cb(void *_udata)
 * {
 *     H5O_mcdt_search_ret_t action = *((H5O_mcdt_search_ret_t *)_udata);
 *
 *      return(action);
 *  }
 *
 *  int main(void) {
 *      hid_t ocpypl_id = H5Pcreate(H5P_OBJECT_COPY);
 *
 *      H5Pset_copy_object(ocpypl_id, H5O_COPY_MERGE_COMMITTED_DTYPE_FLAG);
 *      H5Padd_merge_committed_dtype_path(ocpypl_id, "/group/committed_dtypeA");
 *
 *      action = H5O_MCDT_SEARCH_STOP;
 *      H5Pset_mcdt_search_cb(ocpypl_id, mcdt_search_cb, &action);
 *      H5Ocopy(...ocpypl_id...);
 *      ...
 *      ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * \note H5Pset_mcdt_search_cb() will fail if the
 *       object copy property list is invalid.
 *
 * \warning If the callback function return value causes H5Ocopy() to
 *          abort, the destination file may be left in an inconsistent or
 *          corrupted state.

 *
 * \details H5Pregister1() registers a new property with a property list
 *          class. The property will exist in all property list objects
 *          of that class after this routine is finished.  The name of
 *          the property must not already exist.  The default property
 *          value must be provided and all new property lists created
 *          with this property will have the property value set to the
 *          default provided.  Any of the callback routines may be set
 *          to NULL if they are not needed.
 *
 *          Zero-sized properties are allowed and do not store any data in
 *          the property list. These may be used as flags to indicate the
 *          presence or absence of a particular piece of information. The
 *          default pointer for a zero-sized property may be set to NULL.
 *          The property \p prp_create and \p prp_close callbacks are called for
 *          zero-sized properties, but the \p prp_set and \p prp_get callbacks
 *          are never called.
 *
 *          The \p prp_create routine is called when a new property list with
 *          this property is being created. The #H5P_prp_create_func_t
 *          callback function is defined as #H5P_prp_cb1_t.
 *
 *          The \p prp_create routine may modify the value to be set and those
 *          changes will be stored as the initial value of the property.
 *          If the \p prp_create routine returns a negative value, the new
 *          property value is not copied into the property and the
 *          \p prp_create routine returns an error value.
 *
 *          The \p prp_set routine is called before a new value is copied into
 *          the property. The #H5P_prp_set_func_t callback function is defined
 *          as #H5P_prp_cb2_t.
 *
 *          The \p prp_set routine may modify the value pointer to be set and
 *          those changes will be used when setting the property's value.
 *          If the \p prp_set routine returns a negative value, the new property
 *          value is not copied into the property and the \p prp_set routine
 *          returns an error value. The \p prp_set routine will not be called
 *          for the initial value; only the \p prp_create routine will be
 *          called.
 *
 *          \b Note: The \p prp_set callback function may be useful to range
 *          check the value being set for the property or may perform some
 *          transformation or translation of the value set. The \p prp_get
 *          callback would then reverse the transformation or translation.
 *          A single \p prp_get or \p prp_set callback could handle multiple
 *          properties by performing different actions based on the property
 *          name or other properties in the property list.
 *
 *          The \p prp_get routine is called when a value is retrieved from a
 *          property value. The #H5P_prp_get_func_t callback function is
 *          defined as #H5P_prp_cb2_t.
 *
 *          The \p prp_get routine may modify the value to be returned from the
 *          query and those changes will be returned to the calling routine.
 *          If the \p prp_set routine returns a negative value, the query
 *          routine returns an error value.
 *
 *          The \p prp_del routine is called when a property is being
 *          deleted from a property list. The #H5P_prp_delete_func_t
 *          callback function is defined as #H5P_prp_cb2_t.
 *
 *          The \p prp_del routine may modify the value passed in, but the
 *          value is not used by the library when the \p prp_del routine
 *          returns. If the \p prp_del routine returns a negative value,
 *          the property list deletion routine returns an error value but
 *          the property is still deleted.
 *
 *          The \p prp_copy routine is called when a new property list with
 *          this property is being created through a \p prp_copy operation.
 *          The #H5P_prp_copy_func_t callback function is defined as
 *          #H5P_prp_cb1_t.
 *
 *          The \p prp_copy routine may modify the value to be set and those
 *          changes will be stored as the new value of the property. If
 *          the \p prp_copy routine returns a negative value, the new
 *          property value is not copied into the property and the \p prp_copy
 *          routine returns an error value.
 *
 *          The \p prp_close routine is called when a property list with this
 *          property is being closed. The #H5P_prp_close_func_t callback
 *          function is defined as #H5P_prp_cb1_t.
 *
 *          The \p prp_close routine may modify the value passed in, but the
 *          value is not used by the library when the \p prp_close routine
 *          returns. If the \p prp_close routine returns a negative value, the

 *          object-type-specific closing function (such as H5Gclose()) when no longer needed.
 *
 *          \p loc_id is a location identifier in the file.
 *
 *          The object’s address within the file, \p addr, is the byte offset of the first byte
 *          of the object header from the beginning of the HDF5 file space, i.e., from the
 *          beginning of the super block (see the “HDF5 Storage Model” section of the The
 *          HDF5 Data Model and File Structure chapter of the <em>HDF5 User's Guide</em>.)
 *
 *          \p addr can be obtained via either of two function calls. H5Gget_objinfo() returns
 *          the object’s address in the \c objno field of the H5G_stat_t \c struct;
 *          H5Lget_info() returns the address in the \c address field of the #H5L_info_t \c struct.
 *
 *          The address of the HDF5 file on a physical device has no effect on H5Oopen_by_addr(),
 *          nor does the use of any file driver. As stated above, the object address is its
 *          offset within the HDF5 file; HDF5’s file drivers will transparently map this to an
 *          address on a storage device.
 *
 * \warning This function must be used with care!
 * \warning Improper use can lead to inaccessible data, wasted space in the file,
 *          or <b><em>file corruption</em></b>.
 * \warning This function is dangerous if called on an invalid address. The risk can be safely
 *          overcome by retrieving the object address with H5Gget_objinfo() or H5Lget_info()
 *          immediately before calling H5Oopen_by_addr(). The immediacy of the operation can be
 *          important; if time has elapsed and the object has been deleted from the file,
 *          the address will be invalid and file corruption can result.

 *          \orders
 *
 *          Note that for #H5_ITER_NATIVE, rather than implying a particular order,

 *          resolves to an HDF5 object to open or if the link dangles. The
 *          link may be of any type, but hard links will always resolve
 *          to objects and do not need to be verified.
 *
 *          Note that H5Oexists_by_name() verifies only that the target
 *          object exists. If \p name includes either a relative path or
 *          an absolute path to the target link, intermediate steps
 *          along the path must be verified before the existence of
 *          the target link can be safely checked. If the path is not
 *          verified and an intermediate element of the path does not
 *          exist, H5Oexists_by_name() will fail. The example in the next
 *          paragraph illustrates one step-by-step method for verifying
 *          the existence of a link with a relative or absolute path.
 *
 * \par Example
 *          Use the following steps to verify the existence of
 *          the link \c datasetD in the \c group group1/group2/softlink_to_group3/,
 *          where \c group1 is a member of the group specified by \c loc_id:
 *
 * \par
 *      - First use H5Lexists() to verify that a link named \c group1 exists.
 *      - If \c group1 exists, use H5Oexists_by_name() to verify that the
 *        link \c group1 resolves to an object.
 *      - If \c group1 exists, use H5Lexists() again, this time with name
 *        set to \c group1/group2, to verify that the link \c group2 exists
 *        in \c group1.
 *      - If the \c group2 link exists, use H5Oexists_by_name() to verify
 *        that \c group1/group2 resolves to an object.
 *      - If \c group2 exists, use  H5Lexists() again, this time with name
 *        set to \c group1/group2/softlink_to_group3, to verify that the
 *        link \c softlink_to_group3 exists in \c group2.
 *      - If the \c softlink_to_group3 link exists, use H5Oexists_by_name()
 *        to verify that \c group1/group2/softlink_to_group3 resolves to
 *        an object.
 *      - If \c softlink_to_group3 exists, you can now safely use H5Lexists
 *        with name set to \c group1/group2/softlink_to_group3/datasetD to
 *        verify that the target link, \c datasetD, exists.
 *      - And finally, if the link \c datasetD exists, use H5Oexists_by_name
 *        to verify that \c group1/group2/softlink_to_group3/datasetD
 *        resolves to an object.
 *
 * \par
 *          If the link to be verified is specified with an absolute path,
 *          the same approach should be used, but starting with the first

 *          new link while \p object_id identifies the object that the link

 *
 *          H5Olink() is designed for two purposes:
 *          - To create the first hard link to an object that has just
 *            been created with H5Dcreate_anon(), H5Gcreate_anon(), or
 *            H5Tcommit_anon().
 *          - To add additional structure to an existing

 *            multiple groups.
 *
 *          \p lcpl and \p lapl are the link creation and access property lists
 *          associated with the new link.
 *
 * \par Example:
 *      To create a new link to an object while simultaneously creating
 *      missing intermediate groups: Suppose that an application must
 *      create the group C with the path /A/B01/C but may not know
 *      at run time whether the groups A and B01 exist. The following

 * \par
 * \code
 *
 *      // Creates a link creation property list (LCPL).
 *      hid_t lcpl_id = H5Pcreate(H5P_LINK_CREATE);
 *
 *      // Sets "create missing intermediate groups" property in that LCPL.
 *      int status = H5Pset_create_intermediate_group(lcpl_id, TRUE);
 *
 *      // Creates a group without linking it into the file structure.
 *      hid_t gid  = H5Gcreate_anon(file_id, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT);
 *
 *      // Links group into file structure.
 *      status = H5Olink(gid, file_id, "/A/B01/C", lcpl_id, H5P_DEFAULT);
 *
 * \endcode
 *
 * \par
 *      Note that unless the object is intended to be temporary,
 *      the H5O_LINK call is mandatory if an object created with one
 *      of the H5*_CREATE_ANON functions (or with H5T_COMMIT_ANON)
 *      is to be retained in the file; without an H5O_LINK call,
 *      the object will not be linked into the HDF5 file structure
 *      and will be deleted when the file is closed.

 *          specified by \p ocpypl_id and \p lcpl_id. #H5P_DEFAULT can be passed
 *          in for these property lists. The default behavior:
 *
 *          - of the link creation property list is to NOT create
 *             intermediate groups.
 *          - of the flags specified by the object creation property list
 *            is described in H5Pset_copy_object().
 *
 *          These property lists or flags can be modified to govern the
 *          behavior of H5Ocopy() as follows:
 *
 *          - A flag controlling the creation of intermediate groups that
 *              may not yet exist is set in the link creation property list
 *              \p lcpl_id with H5Pset_create_intermediate_group().
 *
 *          - Copying of committed datatypes can be tuned through the use
 *              of H5Pset_copy_object(), H5Padd_merge_committed_dtype_path(),
 *              H5Pset_mcdt_search_cb(), and related functions.
 *
 *          - Flags controlling other aspects of object copying are set in the
 *              object copy property list \p ocpypl_id with H5Pset_copy_object().
 *
 *          H5Ocopy() will always try to make a copy of the object specified
 *          in \p src_name.
 *
 *          - If the object specified by \p src_name is a group containing a
 *              soft or external link, the default is that the new copy will
 *              contain a soft or external link with the same value as the
 *              original. See H5Pset_copy_object() for optional settings.
 *
 *          - If the path specified in \p src_name is or contains a soft link
 *              or an external link, H5Ocopy() will copy the target object.
 *              Use H5Lcopy() if the intent is to create a new soft or external
 *              link with the same value as the original link.
 *
 *          H5Ocopy() can be used to copy an object in an HDF5 file. If
 *          an object has been changed since it was opened, it should be
 *          written back to the file before using H5Ocopy(). The object
 *          can be written back either by closing the object (H5Gclose(),

 *          an application to perform a common set of operations across
 *          all of those objects or a dynamically selected subset.
 *          For non-recursive iteration across the members of a group,
 *          see H5Literate1().
 *
 *          If \p obj_id is a group identifier, that group serves as the
 *          root of a recursive iteration. If \p obj_id is a file identifier,
 *          that file’s root group serves as the root of the recursive
 *          iteration.  If \p obj_id is an attribute identifier,
 *          then the object where the attribute is attached will be iterated.
 *          If \p obj_id is any other type of object, such as a dataset or
 *          named datatype, there is no iteration.
 *
 *          Two parameters are used to establish the iteration: \p idx_type
 *          and \p order.
 *
 *          \p idx_type specifies the index to be used. If the links in
 *          a group have not been indexed by the index type, they will
 *          first be sorted by that index then the iteration will begin;
 *          if the links have been so indexed, the sorting step will be
 *          unnecessary, so the iteration may begin more quickly.

 *          Note that the index type passed in \p idx_type is a
 *          <em>best effort</em> setting. If the application passes in
 *          a value indicating iteration in creation order and a group is
 *          encountered that was not tracked in creation order, that group
 *          will be iterated over in alpha-numeric order by name, or
 *          <em>name order</em>.  (<em>Name order</em> is the native order
 *          used by the HDF5 library and is always available.)
 *
 *          \p order specifies the order in which objects are to be inspected
 *          along the index specified in \p idx_type.
 *
 *          The H5Ovisit2() \p op_data parameter is a user-defined pointer to the data
 *          required to process objects in the course of the iteration. This pointer
 *          is passed back to each step of the iteration in the callback
 *          function’s \p op_data parameter.
 *
 *          The \p fields parameter contains flags to determine which fields will
 *          be retrieved by the \p op callback function. These flags are defined
 *          in the H5Opublic.h file:
 *          \obj_info_fields
 *
 *          H5Lvisit() and H5Ovisit() are companion functions: one for
 *          examining and operating on links; the other for examining
 *          and operating on the objects that those links point to. Both
 *          functions ensure that by the time the function completes
 *          successfully, every link or object below the specified point
 *          in the file has been presented to the application for whatever
 *          processing the application requires. These functions assume
 *          that the membership of the group being iterated over remains
 *          unchanged through the iteration; if any of the links in the
 *          group change during the iteration, the resulting behavior
 *          is undefined.
 *
 * \note \Bold{Programming Note for C++ Developers Using C Functions:}
 * \note If a C routine that takes a function pointer as an argument is
 *       called from within C++ code, the C routine should be returned
 *       from normally.

 *
 *          The object serving as the root of the iteration is specified
 *          by the \p loc_id / \p obj_name parameter pair. \p loc_id specifies
 *          a file or an object in a file;  if \p loc_id is an attribute identifier,
 *          the object where the attribute is attached will be used.
 *          \p obj_name specifies either an object in the file (with an absolute

 *          to \p loc_id. If \p loc_id fully specifies the object that is to serve

 *          (Note that when \p loc_id fully specifies the object that is to serve

 *

 *
 *          \p idx_type specifies the index to be used. If the links in

 *          the iteration in the callback function’s \p op_data parameter.
 *
 *          \p lapl_id is a link access property list. In the general case,

 *          the link is an external link; an external link may require
 *          that a link prefix be set in a link access property list

 *          of those objects or a dynamically selected subset. For
 *          non-recursive iteration across the members of a group,
 *          see  H5Literate1().
 *
 *          If \p obj_id is a group identifier, that group serves as the
 *          root of a recursive iteration. If \p obj_id is a file identifier,
 *          that file’s root group serves as the root of the recursive
 *          iteration.  If \p obj_id is an attribute identifier,
 *          then the object where the attribute is attached will be iterated.
 *          If \p obj_id is any other type of object, such as a dataset or
 *          named datatype, there is no iteration.
 *
 *          Two parameters are used to establish the iteration: \p idx_type
 *          and \p order.
 *
 *          \p idx_type specifies the index to be used. If the links in
 *          a group have not been indexed by the index type, they will
 *          first be sorted by that index then the iteration will begin;
 *          if the links have been so indexed, the sorting step will be
 *          unnecessary, so the iteration may begin more quickly.
 *
 *          Note that the index type passed in \p idx_type is a
 *          <em>best effort</em> setting. If the application passes in
 *          a value indicating iteration in creation order and a group is
 *          encountered that was not tracked in creation order, that group
 *          will be iterated over in alpha-numeric order by name, or
 *          <em>name order</em>.  (<em>Name order</em> is the native order
 *          used by the HDF5 library and is always available.)
 *
 *          \p order specifies the order in which objects are to be inspected
 *          along the index specified in \p idx_type.
 *
 *          H5Lvisit1() and H5Ovisit1() are companion functions: one for
 *          examining and operating on links; the other for examining
 *          and operating on the objects that those links point to. Both
 *          functions ensure that by the time the function completes
 *          successfully, every link or object below the specified point
 *          in the file has been presented to the application for whatever
 *          processing the application requires. These functions assume
 *          that the membership of the group being iterated over remains
 *          unchanged through the iteration; if any of the links in the
 *          group change during the iteration, the resulting behavior
 *          is undefined.
 *
 * \note \Bold{Programming Note for C++ Developers Using C Functions:}
 * \note If a C routine that takes a function pointer as an argument is
 *       called from within C++ code, the C routine should be returned
 *       from normally.

 *
 *          The object serving as the root of the iteration is specified
 *          by the \p loc_id / \p obj_name parameter pair. \p loc_id specifies
 *          a file or an object in a file;  if \p loc_id is an attribute identifier,
 *          the object where the attribute is attached will be used.
 *          \p obj_name specifies either an object in the file (with an absolute
 *          name based in the file’s root group) or an object name relative
 *          to \p loc_id. If \p loc_id fully specifies the object that is to serve

 *          (Note that when \p loc_id fully specifies the object that is to serve

 *          using H5Ovisit1() instead of H5Ovisit_by_name1().)
 *
 *          Two parameters are used to establish the iteration: \p idx_type
 *          and \p order.
 *
 *          \p idx_type specifies the index to be used. If the links in
 *          a group have not been indexed by the index type, they will

 *
 *          Note that the index type passed in \p idx_type is a
 *          <em>best effort</em> setting. If the application passes in a
 *          value indicating iteration in creation order and a group is
 *          encountered that was not tracked in creation order, that group
 *          will be iterated over in alpha-numeric order by name, or
 *          <em>name order</em>.  (<em>Name order</em> is the native order
 *          used by the HDF5 library and is always available.)
 *
 *          \p order specifies the order in which objects are to be inspected
 *          along the index specified in \p idx_type.
 *
 *          The \p op callback function and the effect of the callback
 *          function’s return value on the application are described
 *          in H5Ovisit1().
 *
 *          The H5O_info1_t \c struct is defined in H5Opublic.h
 *          and described in the H5Oget_info1() function entry.
 *
 *          The H5Ovisit_by_name1() \p op_data parameter is a user-defined
 *          pointer to the data required to process objects in the course
 *          of the iteration. This pointer is passed back to each step of
 *          the iteration in the callback function’s \p op_data parameter.
 *
 *          \p lapl_id is a link access property list. In the general case,
 *          when default link access properties are acceptable, this can
 *          be passed in as #H5P_DEFAULT. An example of a situation that

 *          the link is an external link; an external link may require
 *          that a link prefix be set in a link access property list
 *          (see H5Pset_elink_prefix()).

 *       the C++ application jumps out of the routine back to the C++
 *       “catch” statement, the library is not given the opportunity
 *       to close any temporary data structures that were set up when
 *       the routine was called. The C++ application should save some
 *       state as the routine is started so that any problem that occurs
 *       might be diagnosed.
 *
 * \version 1.10.5 The macro #H5Ovisit_by_name was removed and the function
 *          H5Ovisit_by_name1() was copied to #H5Ovisit_by_name.
 * \version 1.10.3 The H5Ovisit_by_name() function was renamed to H5Ovisit_by_name1(),
 *          and the macro #H5Ovisit_by_name was created.
 * \version 1.8.11 Fortran subroutine introduced in this release.
 *
 * \since 1.8.0

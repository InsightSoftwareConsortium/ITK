/**
 * \ingroup FAPL
 *
 * \brief Sets the Windows I/O driver
 *
 * \fapl_id
 * \returns \herr_t
 *
 * \details H5Pset_fapl_windows() sets the default HDF5 Windows I/O driver on
 *          Windows systems.
 *
 *          Since the HDF5 library uses this driver, #H5FD_WINDOWS, by default
 *          on Windows systems, it is not normally necessary for a user
 *          application to call H5Pset_fapl_windows(). While it is not
 *          recommended, there may be times when a user chooses to set a
 *          different HDF5 driver, such as the standard I/O driver (#H5FD_STDIO)
 *          or the sec2 driver (#H5FD_SEC2), in a Windows
 *          application. H5Pset_fapl_windows() is provided so that the
 *          application can return to the Windows I/O driver when the time
 *          comes.
 *
 *          Only the Windows driver is tested on Windows systems; other drivers
 *          are used at the application’s and the user’s risk.
 *
 *          Furthermore, the Windows driver is tested and available only on
 *          Windows systems; it is not available on non-Windows systems.
 *
 * \since 1.8.0

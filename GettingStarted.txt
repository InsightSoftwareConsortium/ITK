Welcome to the Insight Registration and Segmentation Toolkit (ITK)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Testing the new gerrit and github plugin!

Here are suggested steps for the ITK beginner. Please refer to
https://itk.org for more information.

1) Get the software.

            https://itk.org/ITK/resources/software.html

2) The software is compiled using CMake, http://cmake.org.
   CMake generates Makefiles on Unix platforms, and Visual Studio Solution
   files (or appropriate) build files according to your compiler, operating
   system, and other system variables.

   Create a binary directory, and then run cmake. Provide to CMake the source
   directory of ITK and the binary directory that you just created.

3) Join the mailing list.  Go to https://itk.org/ITK/help/mailing.html
   and follow the instructions there. You may choose to receive a digest version
   of the mail to minimize traffic.

4) Learn the system. Start by looking at the examples found in the
   ITK/Examples directory. Note that this code is heavily commented and works
   with the ITK Software Guide (found at https://itk.org/ItkSoftwareGuide.pdf).
   To build the examples, make sure the CMake flag "BUILD_EXAMPLES" is on. See
   also the Sphinx examples at https://itk.org/ITKExamples and the Wiki examples at
   https://itk.org/Wiki/ITK/Examples.

      subroutine dpofa(a,lda,n,info)
      integer lda,n,info
      double precision a(lda,1)
c
c     dpofa factors a double precision symmetric positive definite
c     matrix.
c
c     dpofa is usually called by dpoco, but it can be called
c     directly with a saving in time if  rcond  is not needed.
c     (time for dpoco) = (1 + 18/n)*(time for dpofa) .
c
c     on entry
c
c        a       double precision(lda, n)
c                the symmetric matrix to be factored.  only the
c                diagonal and upper triangle are used.
c
c        lda     integer
c                the leading dimension of the array  a .
c
c        n       integer
c                the order of the matrix  a .
c
c     on return
c
c        a       an upper triangular matrix  r  so that  a = trans(r)*r
c                where  trans(r)  is the transpose.
c                the strict lower triangle is unaltered.
c                if  info .ne. 0 , the factorization is not complete.
c
c        info    integer
c                = 0  for normal return.
c                = k  signals an error condition.  the leading minor
c                     of order  k  is not positive definite.

Introduction
============
Log4cxx is a port to C++ of the log4j project.
The goal is have the same functionnalities and interfaces of log4j.

Features
========
It's a flexible and highly configurable logging framework
Main features :
- Configurable logging destinations (appenders)
- Configurable logging format (layouts)
- Categorized logging statements through a hierarchy (loggers)
- Advanced filtering (filters)
- Thread safe library
- UTF-16 Unicode support

* Appenders:
  AsyncAppender, ConsoleAppender, DailyRollingFileAppender, FileAppender,
  NTEventLogAppender, ODBCAppender, RollingFileAppender, SMTPAppender,
  SocketAppender, SocketHubAappender, SyslogAppender, TelnetAppender,
  XMLSocketAppender

* Layouts:
  HTMLLayout, PatternLayout, SimpleLayout, TTCCLayout, XMLLayout

* Filters:
  DenyAllFilter, LevelMatchFilter, LevelRangeFilter, StringMatchFilter

* Configurators:
  BasicConfigurator, DOMConfigurator, PropertyConfigurator

* Java like objects with dynamic cast and instanciation. Custom objects can
  be configured through the DOMConfigurator and PropertyConfigurator classes

Supported OS
============
* Linux (tested on Linux Mandrake 10.0)
* FreeBSD
* Windows (MSVC 6.0, MSVC 7.1 or Cygwin)
* Other POSIX OS should be supported but were not tested

Installation
============
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make check
make install

See INSTALL file for further details.

Visual Studio .Net 2003 and Visual Studio 6.0 considerations
============================================================
For projects linking with log4cxx static library, the macro LOG4CXX_STATIC must
be defined (tab C++, textbox Preprocessor in the project properties) and
"log4cxxs.lib" must be passed to the linker (tab Link,textbox Object/Library
Modules in the project settings).

For projects linking with log4cxx dynamic library (dll), "log4cxx.lib" must be
passed to the linker (tab Link,textbox Object/Library Modules in the project
settings).

Unitary Tests
=============
You will need to install
* cppunit (http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/)
* boost regex (http://www.boost.org/)

Unix : run "make check"
Windows : run msvc/tests/runtests.bat

Performance Tests
=================
Just run performance/logging.sh.
The result are expressed in micro-seconds.

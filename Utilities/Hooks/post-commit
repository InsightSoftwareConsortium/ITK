Changes were detected to the third party library $lib. If the change is
relevant to the upstream library, please submit it upstream.

To create a patch file that can be contributed upstream, run:

  git diff -p --relative="$upstream_dir" $sha~1..$sha -- "$top_level_dir/$upstream_dir" > "$patchfile"

EOF
if test -n "$contrib_url"; then
  cat << EOF

Submit the patch file to the upstream library as instructed at

  $contrib_url

EOF
fi
cat << EOF

The patch can be applied to a local $lib repository with

  cd /path/to/$lib
  patch -p1 < $patchfile

## This script is designed to run StriIncludes.py in parallel to significantly reduce
## the processing time for removing unnecessary header includes.

## To run the script you need to edit StripIncludes.py.
## You should also set up the number of processes according to the machine configuration.

from multiprocessing import Pool

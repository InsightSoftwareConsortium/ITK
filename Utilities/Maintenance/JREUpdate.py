Update the JRE tarballs to be bundled with the SCIFIOImageIO plugin.

The OpenJDK JRE (but no the JDK) can be redistributed.  It is downloaded at
build time from Midas and shipped with the SCIFIOImageIO plugin so that the
plugin "just works".

The Fiji fellows maintain Git repositories that tracks the OpenJDK JRE.
Here we clone that repository and create the JRE tarball from it.

Currently, the tarball needs to be uploaded manually to data.kitware.com.
In the future, the Python girder client can be used for automatic upload.

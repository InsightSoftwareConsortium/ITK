This directory contains useful scripts and instructions for
maintaining the ITK source code tree.  These are not intended
to be run all the time, but these little utility scripts
can be useful as new code is being incorporated into ITK to
help configure the code into an ITK style, or ITK best practices.

Note that the files in this directory are not tested automatically
by the continuous integration (CI) of the ITK git repository. So a
git commit that only modifies files in this directory should not
trigger a run of the CI.

2004-11-05 Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * Improve string manipulation. I now inforce the notion of 'DicomString'
    A DicomString can contain as many \0 as they want
    and it is *always* of even length.
    We only support odd length for very rare case. 
    And in the near future this should be removed.

2004-11-03 Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * /binary_write/ gdcm source. Now even on big endian we are writting
    little endian. This should -heopfully- fix some tests

2004-11-03 Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * Now the dictionary is compiled into gdcm lib. This is a default 
    behavior, thus any dic file specified is picked before failback to 
    the one comiled into lib

2004-10-27 Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * Change internals for gdcmDict. Don't use any 'new' any more.
    This should definitely solve any leak problem, and we should be
    as fast as before, as long as don't modify too much the dictionary.

2004-10-25 Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * STYLE: ivars should start with a capital letter. 
  * Accessors should be const to avoid people starting modifying stuff (since this is a ref). 
  * remove 'virtual' as Style specify subclasses shouldn't reuse the keyword
  
2004-10-22 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * Doc/Dicom2004_Part5.pdf added (thanks to JPR).
  * Dicts/dicomTS2004.dic, dicomV3VM2004.dic, groupNameAbbreviations2004.dic
    new 2004 dictionaries added (thanks to JPR).
  * FIX dashboard warning RLEFrame::NumberFragments is now of type unsigned int
  * CLEANUP_ROUND (15) for gdcmPixelConvert
    - RLEFrame::NumberFragments is now of type unsigned int
    - gdcmFile::GetImageData(), GetImageDataIntoVector(), GetImageDataRaw()
      are now all based on PixelConverter. ::GetImageDataIntoVectorRaw()
      no longer exists.

2004-10-21 Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * Initial work in gathering all transfer syntax accessors. clearly 
   IsDecompressed/IsJPEG2000/IsJPEGLossless/IsRLELossless shouldn't be all 
   ivars, but only one transfersyntax (class) ivar with equivalent method on 
   the class.
  
2004-10-21 Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * Removed all FILE* ref and replace by ifstream/ofstream. For now I use a temp 
    solution with the two files jdatadst.cxx and jdatasrc.cxx, this need to be 
    discussed (plus I didn't like having a 2000 lines patch not commited)

2004-10-21 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * src/gdcmDocument.cxx: wrong type on return fixed (thanks dashboard)
  * CLEANUP_ROUND (14) for gdcmPixelConvert
    - PixelConvert::GetLutRGBA(FILE*) is now GetLutRGBA() (no fp needed)
    - PixelConvert::BuildRGBImage()(FILE*) is now BuildRGBImage() (no fp needed)
    - File::GetImageDataIntoVector() doesn't need unnecessary OpenFile() and
      CloseFile() anymore.
    - File::GetImageDataRaw() doesn't call GetImageDataIntoVectorRaw()
      anymore and hence avoids storing a copy of PixelConvert::Decompressed
      into File::Pixel_Data.

2004-10-20 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * src/gdcmDocument.cxx ftell() return properly stored in a long (i.e.
    no longer depends on's programmers PMS = Preposterous Mood Swings ;).
  * CLEANUP_ROUND (13) for gdcmPixelConvert
    Substituted File::ParsePixelData() with PixelConvert::Print() new
    method:
    - src/gdcmParsePixels.cxx removed (only contained File::ParsePixelData())
    - src/gdcmRLEFrame.cxx, gdcmJPEGFragment.cxx added. Added a ::Print()
      method to those classes.
    - src/gdcmFile.[cxx|h]:
      -- Added a ::Print() method.
      -- PixelConverter is now a reference instead of a member.
      -- gdcmPython/gdcm.i: added "using namespace gdcm" in order for
         gdcm_wrap.cxx to "understand" File::GetPixelConverter()

2004-10-18 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * Doc/CMakeLists.txt, doxygen.config.in: when dot is present the
    collaboration diagram and inheritance diagram should be generated with
    doxygen.
  * Doc/Website/Sidebar.html: Dashboard is now also in the sidebar.
  * gdcmPython/gdcm.i: gdcmRLEFramesInfo.h gdcmJPEGFragmentsInfo.h are
    pointlessly wrapped (see
    http://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/pipermail/dcmlib/2004-October/000692.html )
  * CLEANUP_ROUND (12) for gdcmPixelConvert (sugar is my friend stage)
    - Header::GetLUTRGBA() moved to PixelConvert::GetLutRGBA()
    - vtk/vtkGdcmReader.cxx: adapted to displacment of Header::GetLUTRGBA()
    - Document::RLEInfo and JPEGInfo are now pointer members (Swig thing)
    - src/gdcmFile.[cxx|h] and gdcmPixelConvert.[cxx|h]:
      -- File::Initialise: PixelConverter setup moved away to
           PixelConverter::GrabInformationsFromHeader()
      -- File::GetImageDataIntoVector(): Lut R + Lut G + Lut B color table
         interpretation moved away to PixelConverter::BuildRGBImage()

2004-10-16 Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * Remove GDCM_EXPORT keyword from gdcm::DirList due to :
    http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q168/9/58.ASP

2004-10-15 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * src/gdcmDebug.cxx last ditch attempt to get warning/error messages
    displayed on Win32 when a brutal abort() occurs (because of uncatched
    exception). See TODO new entry of this commit for more on this.
  * TODO added new entry.
  * CLEANUP_ROUND (12) for gdcmPixelConvert (nicotine is my friend stage)
    src/gdcmFile.[cxx|h] and gdcmPixelConvert.[cxx|h]:
    - HandleColor is no longer called from gdcmFile.cxx
    - gdcmPixelConvert.cxx clean up on method arguments and internal
      variable names for semantical coherence.

2004-10-14 Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * Finished lossless transition, not only do we now read all lossless jpeg
  images, without the need of the Cornwell lib, but we do read them properly now
  * To reduce code (well to avoid code duplication), I defined a common place
  for jpeg read/write: gdcmJpeg.cxx. Now gdcmJpeg[8,12 16] include this file and
  redefine symbols. This is not prefect but this the best solution I found for a
  compilation time jpeg option.

2004-10-13 Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * Update jpeg ijg lib to support lossless jpeg implementation
    For more info look in jpeg/libijg/README.GDCM.txt for necessary steps to
    reproduce at home.
  * Also added a special copyright for dcmtk since we use their bugfixes.
  Thanks dcmtk crew !

2004-10-13 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * Doc/Website/MailingList.html added (Sidebar.html changed accordingly).
  * gdcmPython/gdcm.i: fix for compilation of wrappers (Note: %include order
    matters, as stated in warning note at begining of %include section).
  * src/gdcmDicomDir*.[cxx|h]: coding style
  * src/gdcmDocument.h: doxygen \ref seems uncompatible with \todo.
  * src/gdcmJpeg8.cxx: doxygen fix.
  * CLEANUP_ROUND (12) for gdcmPixelConvert (seing the ligth stage)
    src/gdcmFile.[cxx|h] and gdcmPixelConvert.[cxx|h]: color handling moved
    from File:: to PixelConvert::.

2004-10-12 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * CLEANUP_ROUND (11) for gdcmPixelConvert (cafeine is my friend stage)
    src/gdcmFile.[cxx|h] and gdcmPixelConvert.[cxx|h]:
     - more code moved away from File:: to PixelConvert::
     - fat setup of PixelConverter set in place in File::Initialise.

2004-10-12 Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * Apply patch for namespace in gdcm. Didn't rename files for keeping a sort of
  namespace at the file system level. So now you should convert your examples
  like this:
    gdcmHeader  ->   gdcm::Header
  It would be nice if people keep in mind to no open the namespace, since it
  allows compilation on broken plateform which were defining common symbol in
  the standart namespace (like LP, Unknown ...)

2004-10-10 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * CLEANUP_ROUND (10) for gdcmPixelConvert (Xanax is my friend stage)
    The JPEG fragments are now parsed at the same stage than the RLE
    information. All code related to JPEG is now in gdcmPixelConvert:
    - src/gdcmJPEGFragment.h and gdcmJPEGFragmentsInfo.[h|cxx] added 
    - src/gdcmJpeg12.cxx, gdcmJpeg2000.cxx and gdcmJpeg8.cxx no longer
      export a gdcmFile:: method. Those are simply global functions
      (for the time being this is better than having them attach to
       either gdcmFile:: or gdcmPixelConvert::).
    - src/gdcmDocument.[cxx|h], gdcmDocument:: now parser the JPEG fragments
      and stores the result in a gdcmJPEGFragmentsInfo.
    - src/gdcmFile.[cxx|h] and gdcmPixelConvert.[cxx|h]: all JPEG related
      code (among other stuff) moved away from gdcmFile:; to 
      gdcmPixelConvert::

2004-10-08 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * src/gdcmCommon.h now declares int8_t for non stdint.h plateforms.
  * CLEANUP_ROUND (7) for gdcmPixelConvert (lost at sea)
    - src/gdcmFile.h gdcmPixelConvert.cxx gdcmPixelConvert.h gdcmRLE.cxx:
      clean up of RLE related code. 
  * CLEANUP_ROUND (8) for gdcmPixelConvert (end of RLE nigthmare)
    - src/gdcmRLE.cxx removed
    - src/gdcmPixelConvert.cxx all RLE code is now in PixelConvert::
    - src/CMakeLists.txt gdcmFile.[cxx|h] changed accordingly
    - src/gdcmRLEFrame*.h gdcmPixelConvert is now a friend class.
  * CLEANUP_ROUND (9) for gdcmPixelConvert
    - src/gdcmFile.[cxx|h} gdcmPixelConvert.[cxx|h], SwapZone(),
      ConvertReorderEndianity(), ConvertDecmpres12BitsTo16Bits() moved
      away from gdcmFile:: to gdcmPixelConvert::.

2004-10-07 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * CLEANUP_ROUND (5) for gdcmPixelConvert (Upshit creek without a paddle)
    - src/gdcmDocument.[cxx|h] Parse7Fe0 renamed to ComputeRLEInfo.
      This is because Parse7Fe0 used to parse the pixels to compute the
      length. This task was passed over to FindDocEntryLengthOB() a long
      time ago, EXCEPT I had forgotten the OW case...
      Hence Parse7Fe0 was no longer necessary. When renaming to ComputeRLEInfo
      we just recylce the code for parsing RLE fragments and computing
      offsets.
  * CLEANUP_ROUND (6) for gdcmPixelConvert (man, I need a paddle bad)
    - src/gdcmRLE.cxx: is now much simpler and avoids code replication
        with the retired Parse7Fe0().
    - src/gdcmRLEFrame.h: type fix for properly computing OffSet[]
    - src/gdcmDocument.cxx: segments offset are now correct + clean up.

2004-10-06 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * CLEANUP_ROUND (3) for gdcmPixelConvert (nightmare stage)
    - src/gdcmRLEFramesInfo.[cxx|h], gdcmRLEFrame.h added
    - src/gdcmDocument.[cxx|h] ::Parse7FE0 now sets up the RLEInfo.
    - src/CMakeLists.txt: alphabetic order reodering + new entries.
  * CLEANUP_ROUND (4) for gdcmPixelConvert
    - src/gdcmDocument.[cxx|h] ::ParseDES and ::ParseSQ no longer bother
      to return an unused length.

2004-10-09 Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * Remove all sprintf from the code to centralize in one spot in gdcmUtil
    this should be cleanner from the plane view. The iostream are erally a pain
    to use to do simple stuff.

2004-10-04 Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * Redo the compilation of the ijg jpeg library. Now only one source is
    necesseray. No need to rename file by hand what so ever. CMake handle the
    copying of the file within different directory, configure header file to
    modify some symbol. The only addition made to ijg wasd a mangle table so
    that symbol are different wether we are within 8bits or 12bits.

2004-10-01 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * Added documentation of vtkgdcmReader on Website:
     - testvtkGdcmReader.cxx renamed to vtkGdcmDemo.cxx (to be compatible
       with it's binary name).
     - vtk/vtkGdcmDemo.cxx and vtkgdcmViewer.cxx: added comments for
       the Website to be more complete.
     - Doc/doxygen.config.in: vtk/vtkGdcmReader.cxx now appears on 
       doxygenated documentation.
     - Doc/DoxyVtkGdcmReaderExamples.txt added
       (see http://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Public/Gdcm/html.developper/
                  DoxyVtkGdmReaderExamples.html )
  * src/win32, vtk/win32 manually maintained .dsp and .dsw removed.
  * CLEANUP_ROUND (3) for gdcmPixelConvert
   - src/gdcmFile.cxx, gdcmFile.h splitting GetImageDataIntoVectorRaw

2004-09-29 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * CLEANUP_ROUND (2) for gdcmPixelConvert
   - src/gdcmFile.cxx, gdcmFile.h splitting GetImageDataIntoVectorRaw

2004-09-29 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * CLEANUP_ROUND for gdcmPixelConvert:
    - src/gdcmFile.cxx, gdcmFile.h, gdcmHeader.cxx, gdcmHeader.h clean up
    - src/gdcmPixelStuff[h|cxx] removed
    - src/gdcmPixelConvert[h|cxx] added. Preparatory work included.
    - src/CMakeLists.txt changed accordingly
  * GDCMHOME clean up:
    - MANIFEST.in, WrapSwig.py, WrapVTK.py, distutilsWrapping.py and
      gdcmVersion.py moved to newly created ATTIC related
      gdcmPython/SetupOldies/ directory.
  * Autotools clean up:
    - */*/Makefile.am removed AT EXCEPTION of gdcmPython/Makefile.am
    - autogen.sh configure.in acinclude.m4 python.m4 removed 

2004-09-27 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * src/*.cxx *.h Reference to License.htm fixed to License.html.
  * Doc/CMakeLists.txt, doxygen.config.in: fix.
  * Doc/Website/ConformanceSummary.html, minimal conformance statement added.

2004-09-24 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * TODO updated with Mathieu suggestions. I proposed a template for
    describing TODO entries and used it for new entries.
  * Added Doc/Website/CodingStyle.html, Developpers.html,
    DeveloppersPython.html, GdcmDataCvs.html and
    DownloadVersion0_1.html, DownloadVersion0_3.html.
  * Some Doc/*.txt Doxygen files (which do not really concern the
    documentation itself, but the website) moved to html and
    placed in directory Doc/Website:
    - Doc/DoxyDevelInstal.txt moved to Doc/Website/Developpers.html
    - Doc/DoxyInstallation.txt moved to Doc/Website/Installation.html
    - Doc/DoxyIntroduction.txt included in Doc/Website/Main.html
  * Doc/DoxyfileDeveloppers, DoxyfileUsers, Makefile.am oldies removed.
  * CMakeLists.txt changed accordingly.
  * DEVELOPPER spread out in Doc/Website/Developpers.html, CodingStyle.html,
    DeveloppersPython.html
  * INSTALL nows refers to Doc/Website/Installation.html

2004-09-23 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * Added Doc/Website directory, that contains a first raw version
    of gdcm Web site.

2004-09-23 Jean-Pierre Roux
  * FIX In order not to be poluted any longer by casting problems,
    the member VoidArea of gdcmBinEntry is now uint8_t* (instead of void *)
	 we can now delete[] it safely 	
  * VoidArea is now called BinArea (less confusing name),
    and all the methods called ...VoidArea... are now ... BinArea...
  * class gdcmObject is now called gdcmDicomDirObject (less confusing name)

2004-09-22 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * src/gdcmDocument.cxx: gdcmDocument::~gdcmDocument() doesn't clear (nor
    clear) TagHT, which is an inherited member of gdcmElementSet. It is
    up to the destructor of gdcmElementSet to clean up TagHt and it's
    pointed content.

2004-09-21 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * Test/CMakeLists.txt: update to follow gdcmData renamings.
  * src/gdcmCommon.h, gdcmDocument.cxx: doxygen typos

2004-09-17 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * ENH: added some utility method that builds a flat dictionnary
    holding all the Dicom entries contained in the recursive structure
    of a gdcmElementSet. Refer to add FlatHashTablePrint.cxx for 
    an example of usage.
    - src/gdcmDocument.[h|cxx] added BuildFlatHashTableRecurse() and
      BuildFlatHashTable() that build a flat dictionary.
    - src/gdcmElementSet.h: added a new private GetTag() accessor.
      gdcmDocument is now a friend of gdcmElementSet.
    - src/gdcmElementSet.cxx: clean up.
    - Example/FlatHashTablePrint.cxx added.
    - Example/CmakeLists.txt changed accordingly

2004-09-16 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * gdcmDocEntrySet::SQDepthLevel and gdcmDocEntrySet::BaseTagKey attributes
    moved away from gdcmDocEntrySet (since this class is an abstract class
    acting like an interface). SQDepthLevel and BaseTagKey are now
    in class 
    - src/gdcmDocEntrySet.[h|cxx] removal of SQDepthLevel and BaseTagKey
      and associated accessors. Doxygenation of the class.
    - src/gdcmSQItem.[h|cxx] SQDepthLevel and BaseTagKey and associated
      accessors added.
    - src/gdcmSeqEntry.[h|cxx]: constructor doesn't handle depth anymore.
      Use SQDepthLevel accessor instead. ::Print() adapted.
    - src/gdcmElementSet.cxx changed according to changes in gdcmSeqEntry.
    - src/gdcmDocument.cxx changed accordingly.

2004-09-13 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * Preparation of writing a gdcmHeader iterator: generalisation of gdcmTagKey
    - The following is the doxygen comment of the typedef declaration
      of gdcmagKey in src/gdcmCommon.h:
           gdcmTagKey is made to old an "universal" (as in URL, Universal
           Ressource Locator)  key to a gdcmDocEntry i.e. a dicom tag.
           A dicom tag allways has a group and an element, but a set of tags
           embeded in various (optionally nested) sequences and sharing
           the same group and element all share the same (group, element)
           "identifier". Hence the (group, element) cannot be used as an
           identifier (in gdcm we shall refer to a "TagKey") of a tag.
           In order to construct a proper tag identifier (i.e. a key) we
           consider the following definition of a TagKey:
           - let Group, Element be the string representation of the
             group and element dicom tag members,
           - let ItemNumber be the string representation of the integer
             index of the considered item number of a sequence,
           Let the key of a tag embeded in a sequence, noted SeqTag, be
           the form:
              /ItemNumber#Group|Element
           where "/", "#" and "|" are characters acting as separators.
           Then the general form of a gdcmTagKey is given by:
              Group|Element<SeqTag>
           where <SeqTag> means NO or many instances of SeqTag.
           Hence the gdcmTagKey of a tag not "leaving" in a sequence is the
           string e.g.
               0028|1201
           but the gdcmTagKey of a tag "embeded" is the first item of
           a sequence, itself nested in the third item of a sequence is the
           string e.g.
               0004|1220/2#0008|0082/0#0008|0090
    - src/gdcmDocEntry.h: added a new Key (of type gdcmTagKey) member, in
      order to hold the new sequence compatible key. Previously, the 
      GetKey() method would look in the underlying gdcmDictEntry.
    - src/gdcmDocEntry.cxx:
      -- constructor now copies the underlying DictEntry key, in the local
         Key member.
      -- ::Print: displays the member Key, instead of the (group, element).
    - src/gdcmCommon.h: added some comments on typedef gdcmTagKey.
    - src/gdcmDocEntrySet.h:xi
      -- ::ParseDES() now setups the gdcmTagKey of the sequence it is parsing.
      -- now has a new BaseTagKey member.
      -- STYLE.
  * src/gdcmValEntry.[h|cxx], src/gdcmBinEntry.[h|cxx]: the member VoidArea,
    previously a member of gdcmValEntry, moved to gdcmBinEntry were is
    truly belongs.
    This poses the problem with the semantics of the following lines
       LoadEntryVoidArea(0x0028,0x1201);  // R    LUT
       LoadEntryVoidArea(0x0028,0x1202);  // G    LUT
       LoadEntryVoidArea(0x0028,0x1203);  // B    LUT
    in gdcmDocument::gdcmDocument(std::string const & ). Please refer
    to the long FIXME note for what the problem is. Nevertheless in
    order to get things working the dicom dictionary was altered !
    Please fix things urgently...
  * Dicts/dicomV3.dic WRONGLY altered (this means we introduced a uncorrect
    information), see above note on moving the member VoidArea. Nevertheless
    the following entries previously correctly set as US are now inproperly
    set to OW:
      0028 1201 OW IMG Red Palette Color Lookup Table Data
      0028 1202 OW IMG Green Palette Color Lookup Table Data
      0028 1203 OW IMG Blue Palette Color Lookup Table Data
  * src/gdcmDocEntry.[h|cxx], src/gdcmSeqEntry.h: SQDepthLevel member
    of gdcmDocEntry moved to gdcmSeqEntry.
  * src/gdcmSeqEntry.cxx: STYLE.

2004-08-04 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * Test/TestAllEntryVerify.cxx minor fix and added comments.

2004-08-03 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * gdcmPython/testSuite.py: all the test suite in python is now moved
    to it's C++ version (see gdcmData/TestAllEntryVerifyReference.txt)
  * Test/CMakeLists.txt adapted to renaming of files in gdcmData
  * gdcm/TODO and src/gdcmDictSet.h cleaned up frow the "TODO Swig" oldies

2004-08-02 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * gdcmPython/CMakeLists.txt: SWIG_FLAGS doesn't declare includeall
    to avoid inclusion recursion until STL is reached.
  * src/gdcmDocument.[h|cxx]: exceptions substituted to errno C-style
    mecanism. errno.h is not included in gdcm anymore.
  * src/gdcmException.h: introduced new gdcmFormatUnexpected class
    (gdcmFormatError now inherits from gdcmFormatUnexpected).
  * TODO updated
  * gdcmPython/testSuite.py checks on CR-MONO1-10-chest.dcm moved to
    gdcmData/TestAllEntryVerifyReference.txt
  * Test/TestAllEntryVerify.cxx is now effective (used allways return true)
  * src/gdcmDocument.[cxx|h]: constructors no longer use the bool
    exception_on_error parameter.
    - src/gdcmFile.[cxx|h], src/gdcmHeader.[cxx|h] changed accordingly,
    - vtk/vtkGdcmReader.cxx changed accordingly,
    - Example/*.cxx and Test/*.cxx changed accordingly.

2004-07-06 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * src/gdcmDicomDir.cxx, gdcmDocEntrySet.cxx: removed inclusion of errno.h
  * src/gdcmDocument.[h|cxx], gdcmFile.[h|cxx], gdcmHeader.[h|cxx]:
    enable_sequences removed from gdcmHeader constructor and dependencies.
  * Example/PrintHeader.cxx: fixed accordingly (enable_sequences removal).
  * gdcmPython/demo/PrintHeader.py: dummy fix.
  * src/gdcmDocument.[h|cxx], gdcmFile.[h|cxx], gdcmHeader.[h|cxx]:
    skip_shadow removed from gdcmHeader constructor and dependencies.
  * Example/*.cxx and Test/*.cxx changed accordingly.

2004-07-27 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
  * Test/CMakeLists.txt: newly re-introduced SIEMENS_Sonata-12-MONO2-SQ.dcm
    in gdcmData (previously known as E00001S03I0015.dcm) is blacklisted.

2004-07-21 Jean-Pierre Roux
  * FIX Now, Parsing and Printing a DICOMDIR do work!
       ( troubles remain in makeDicomDir and BuildUpDicomDir :-(
		 
2004-07-20 Jean-Pierre Roux
  * FIX Some brain damaged headers have Zero-Lenght fields 
        for 'Transfert Syntax UID', or 'Media Stored SOP Class UID'.

2004-07-19 Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
   * src/gdcmCommon.h, gdcmDict.cxx, gdcmTS.cxx : bug fix for msvc6 compilation
   * src/gdcmDebug.[h|cxx] : bug fix for msvc6 compilation. Replace the dbg
     variable (instance of gdcmDebug) by a definition macro, and the instance
     is now in static in the gdcmDebug class
   * src/gdcmSQItem.h : (FIXME) remove an undefined method
   * Test/PrintAllDocument.cxx : bug fix in the result of the test

2004-07-06 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
   * WARNING: ctest now depends more tightly on gdcmData. You should
     check out gdcmData properly for things to run smoothly...
   * src/gdcmDocument.cxx MAX_SIZE_LOAD_ELEMENT_VALUE is set back to 0xfff
     (4096) for "ctest -R TestAllEntryVerify" to be able to run (i.e.
     we need the pixels not be loaded in order to use the ValEntry
     that displays position and size).
   * Test/TestAllEntryVerify.cxx a new low level test now seems fair.
     This is a C++ based equivalent of gdcmPython/testSuite.py that should
     be deprecated. If you have any doubts about the advantages of a
     modern scripting language (read Python) versus grass root C++ (i.e.
     without lex + yacc, because of gdcm commitement to MS-VC++, sighhh),
     I suggest you compare TestAllEntryVerify.cxx (639 lines, without the
     reference file gdcmData/TestAllEntryVerifyReference.txt) and testSuite.py.
        Anyhow, consider documenting the gdcmData images in 
     gdcmData/TestAllEntryVerifyReference.txt (and please run ctest before
     commiting changes).
   * Test/CMakeLists.txt:
      - now uses TestAllEntryVerify.cxx
      - specific comments on oldACR00001.ima (now renamed in gdcmData
        to SIEMENS_GBS_III-16-ACR_NEMA_1.acr) moved away to
        gdcmData/TestAllEntryVerifyReference.txt
   * TODO updated.

2004-07-02 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
   * src/*.[h|cxx] : typedef clean up
     - guint16 and guint32 removed. Use ISO C uint16_t, uint32_t instead.
     - TagKey renamed to gdcmTagKey (for external usage)
     - VRKey renamed to gdcmVRKey (for external usage)
     - removal of typedef duplication.
     - Removed all unecessary inline keyword from class inline definitions.
     - Some method|function(void) declarations replaced with method|function().
   * src/jpeg/libijg12/jdhuff12.c:
      - printf polluting ctest removed.
      - TAB removal for comminting
   * Test:
     - TestAllReadCompareDicom.cxx: added a test that compares all the
       images in gdcmDataImages.h with corresponding images in 
       gdcmData/BaselineDicom/. When baseline images are not present
       this test creates them.
       Note: we need to validate each reference image, but before that
             I'd like to rename them with a more explicit name...
     - CMakeLists.txt: changed accordingly.
   * Example/*.cxx: examples now only include gdcm.h (as opposed to 
     including each header needed).

2004-07-01 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
   * Test/*.cxx and Example/*.cxx: moved some examples away from the
     test suite to the Example directory. Are concerned:
     - PrintHeader.cxx
     - TestDcm2Acr.cxx
     - TestFindTags.cxx
     - TestWrite.cxx was
     - TestWriteSimple.cxx
   * Test/CMakeLists.txt: added some comments on reasons for black listing
     image gdcmData/oldACR00001.ima

2004-06-30 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
   * Test/CmakeList.txt: removed the following from black list (to be coherent
     with removal from gdcmData):
      - gdcm-MR-PHILIPS-16-Multi-Seq.fixed.dcm
      - gdcm-MR-PHILIPS-16.dcm
      - US.3405.1.dcm
     Added the following because after last cvs update, they cause
       ctest -R TestReadWriteReadCompare 
     to segfault:
      - gdcm-MR-SIEMENS-16-1.acr
      - oldACR00001.ima
   * Test/TestReadWriteReadCompare.cxx was properly written (with a call
     to gdcmFile::SetImageData()) BUT since gdcmFile is brain damaged (see
     new comments in this file) we temporarily (sigh) move to a weaker
     form of test...
   * Test/CmakeList.txt: with the change to Test/TestReadWriteReadCompare.cxx
     we don't need to black list the following images anymore:
      - 8BitsUncompressedColor.dcm
      - OT-PAL-8-face.dcm
      - US-PAL-8-10x-echo.dcm
   * src/gdcmDocument.[h|cxx]: RE-Reverting to version 1.42 with the proper
     fixes and the beautified code ;-)
     This fixes the bug introduced in version 1.42 (when beautifying)
     that made the parsing of 8BitsRunLengthColor.dcm unproper.
     Note: ctest was blind to this bug (this means we need to still
           improve the test suite). The bug could be detected by using
           gdcmbin/bin/PrintDocument $GDCM_DATA/8BitsRunLengthColor.dcm
           or by using
           gdcmbin/bin/ReadWrite $GDCM_DATA/8BitsRunLengthColor.dcm
           and by displaying the (garbage) produced file temp.XDCM...

2004-06-29 Jean-Pierre Roux
   FIX : - remove Frog's beautified, but never checked 'Parse7FE0' code,
         - replace by uggly but working old code :-(
		A lot of things should be OK again.
	It's really urgent to have a test suite that *tests*, 
	to prevent Frog's beautifying sessions to break all the stuff
	(twice, withing a fortnigh ...) 	

2004-06-28 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
   * Test/TestWriteRead.cxx and TestReadWrite.cxx merged (because of
     redundancy) to added Test/TestReadWriteReadCompare.cxx
   * Test/CmakeList.txt: because the compare test of
     Test/TestReadWriteReadCompare.cxx fails, the following images are
     black listed: - 8BitsUncompressedColor.dcm
                   - OT-PAL-8-face.dcm
                   - US-PAL-8-10x-echo.dcm
   * src/gdcmDocument.cxx: for broken (non DICOM V3 conformal) images
     (e.g. gdcm-JPEG-LossLess3a.dcm see comments in
     gdcm/gdcmPython/testSuite.py for details) ::FindDocLengthOB() had
     and ad-hoc kludge. This kludge is now removed, and on encountering
     such an image (OB field brain damaged) we set errno. Then in 
     ::FindDocLength() we "fix" the length as being ALL what remains
     in the file (until EOF). We then proceed, hoping for the best...
     This fixes a SegFault in ShowDicom when trying to write such an
     image.
   * Test/CmakeList.txt: 8BitsRunLengthColor.dcm is now blacklisted
     (because TestWriteRead breaks on it, after a non conformal commit?).
     ctest now runs properly, except for MakeDicomDir (which was allways
     broken) and the Python related stuff (still not fixed).
   
2004-06-24 Jean-Pierre Roux
  ADD : Examples/WriteRead, that acts like the former Test/TestWriteRead
  FIX : Test/TestReadWrite now iterates on all the file names 
                          (instead of infinite loop)
  ENH : Test/TestWriteRead now iterates on all the file names 

2004-06-28 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
   * Test/TestReadWrite.cxx: now uses all the images of gdcmData.

2004-06-24 Jean-Pierre Roux
   FIX : - now Write drops LUT Descriptors and LUTs (if any)
	            when SamplesPerPixel =3
         - now Write is no longer confused by 
			      'BitsAllocated = 12" and 'BitsStored=12"
         - "UN" value representation Elements are now written correctly 
               (their legth is stored on 4 bytes -just like OB, OW, and SQ-)									
   ENH : - now gdcmHeader has its own Write methods 
	            (in order to split the job that has not to be done 
					for gdcmDicomDir)

2004-06-23 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
   * Test/PrintAllDocument.cxx: looping on files is now effective. It used to
     loop on the same image until memory went out. 
     Note: this means we still have gobs of memory loss in PrintDocument
   * src/gdcmDocument.cxx: fixes problem on parsing on file
     gdcmData/16BitsJpegLosslessGrayScale.dcm.

2004-06-24 Jean-Pierre Roux
   FIX : Write - All the Sequences and Sequence Item are now written 
            as 'no length' stuff, and a Sequence Delimitor aor an Item Delimitor
				is added a the end, when necessary.
            - A lot of brain-damaged images, that were read correctly are 
		      now written correctly
				- length compatible BinEntry are now loaded correctly 
				(even for odd groups) 
        Note : only Explicit Value Representation was checked.
				(question : is implicit VR really necessary for gdcm ?)

2004-06-23 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
   * DEVELOPPER: added a proposition of coding style.
   * src/gdcmDocEntry.h: removed every inline declaration (for test of 
     coding style).

2004-06-23 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
   * gdcmDocEntry::PrintCommonPart() and ::WriteCommonPart() removed.
     Use the gdcmDocEntry::Print() and Write() instead.
   * src/gdcmDocument.cxx: bug fix.

2004-06-22 Jean-Pierre Roux
   FIX : gdcmDocument.cxx
      - Now we do recognize the JpegLossLess format (there was a misstyping in
        code 'beautyfication' :-(
      - Now we automaticaticaly load the Luts, if any

2004-06-22 Jean-Pierre Roux
   In order : to write Sequences, whatever their imbrication level, 
	         : to allow user to create his own Sequences

2004-06-21 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
    * Test/TestWriteSimple.cxx: fix to gdcmHeader-gdcmHeaderHelper revamping.
      The default constructor invoked by the line
         gdcmHeader *f1 = new gdcmHeader( header );
      was gdcmHeader::gdcmHeader(bool) instead of the expected
      gdcmHeader::gdcmHeader(std::string const &, bool = false, bool, bool).
      Hence the parsing wasn't executed... See also below.
    * src/gdcmHeader.h: the declaration of gdcmHeader::gdcmHeader(bool)
      as explicit constructor didn't do the trick to fix the above problem.
      Could anyone explain why ?
    * src/gdcmBinEntry.cxx, gdcmValEntry.cxx: gdcmBinEntry::Print() now
      properly calls gdcmValEntry::Print() (that was weed out from 
      code related to gdcmBinEntry).

2004-06-20 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
    * In order to fix memory leaks:
     - Test/TestWriteSimple.cxx: added cleaning of free store through
       some delete calls.
     - src/gdcmBinEntry.cxx: fix to avoid SegFault.
     - src/gdcmDicomDir.[cxx|h]: fixed initialisation in constructor
       gdcmDicomDir::gdcmDicomDir(bool) [either the constructor itself
       (through the call to ::AddDicomDirMeta()) or the destructor
       would crash when deleting uninitialized ::metaElems].
     - src/gdcmDictEntry.cxx: annotation of ununderstood memory leak.
     - src/gdcmDocument.cxx:
       -- ::~gdcmDocument() destructor now cleans up all dictionary entries
          from dynamic stores.
       -- ::ParseDES() misplaced deletion of temporary NewDocEntry
          was causing memory leaks.
     - src/gdcmSQItem.cxx:
       -- ::~gdcmSQItem() dummy code cleaned (learned that deletion is
          cleanly handled with polymophism: sorry but my milage is low).
       -- ::SetEntryByNumber(string, guint16, guint16) now cleanly allocates
          a gdcmValENtry, and makes no assumption on type (gdcmDocEntry,
          gdcmSeqEntry vs gdcmValEntry) of existing entry (when present).
          This avoids SegFaulting.
     - src/gdcmSQItem.h: coding style.
    * Conclusion:
     - Test/TestWriteSimple still severely sucks. The output image content
       (when $(GDCMDATA_HOME)/012345.002.050.dcm in input) is brain
       damaged when displayed with vtkgdcmViewer.
     - on memory leaks: TestWriteSimple leaks really less (see entry
       of 2004-06-18 in Changelog file for the call to valgrind).
     - on segfaults: ctest now passes all the tests but one (no more
       segfaults).
    * Erroneous leading white fix:
     - src/gdcmDict.cxx: getline(from,xxx) doesn't remove the leading
       white[s] (as opposed to from >> xxx, that removes it [them].
     - src/gdcmTS.cxx: ditto.
     - gdcmPython/testSuite.py: dirty related kludge removed.
    * src/*: remaining references to gdcmParser removed.
    * src/*[cxx|h]: added copy[way]left header.


2004-06-18 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
    * In order to fix writing of dicom files:
     - Test/TestWriteSimple.cxx: a simpler example of writing.
     - Test/CMakeLists.txt changed accordingly.
     - src/gdcmDocument.cxx:
       -- The destructor now recursilvely removes potential sequences.
       -- Bug fix in ::IsJPEG2000()
       -- ::ReplaceOrCreateByNumber(std::string, guint16, guint16)
          now handles promotion of gdcmDocEntry to gdcmValEntry in a cleaner
          manner.
       -- ::GetValEntryByNumber(guint16, guint16) now defined (as opposed
          to only declared) and build on top of
          ::GetDocEntryByNumber(guint16, guint16).
       -- ::SetEntryByNumber() now uses GetValEntryByNumber(group, element)
     - src/gdcmElementSet.[h|cxx]: added ::RemoveEntry(gdcmDocEntry *)
       for usage in destructor and treatement of promotion in
       ::ReplaceOrCreateByNumber().
     - src/gdcmSQItem.cxx: destructor should better handle his job.
      Test/TestWriteSimple now runs (or at least it DOES something).
    * We can now start hutting memory links. A good starting point is:
      valgrind -q --skin=memcheck --leak-check=yes --leak-resolution=high
      --num-callers=100 --show-reachable=yes gdcmTests TestWriteSimple
      $(GDCMDATA_HOME)/012345.002.050.dcm foo.dcm

2004-06-18 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
    * Valgrind note: after Mathieu Malaterre teached me how to read
      the valgrind FAQ ;-] (see http://valgrind.kde.org/faq.html), I
      learned that:
          Using gcc, you can force the STL to use malloc and to free memory as
          soon as possible by globally disabling memory caching.
          With 3.2.2 and later, you should export the environment variable
          GLIBCPP_FORCE_NEW before running your program.
      By setting GLIBCPP_FORCE_NEW, STL related memory leak messages of gdcm
      simply vanish (it is still not clear to me, whether this means that
      STL std::string leaks or if valgrind believes it leaks...).
    * Fixing of SegFault of Test/makeDicomDir (as shown by ctest or by
      running bin/gdcmTests makeDicomDir):
      - src/gdcmDicomDir.cxx: dynamic casting used + clean up.
      - Test/makeDicomDir.cxx now properly traps empty lists and returns
        with 1.
      NOW, makeDicomDir cleanly fails (in ctest terminology) instead of
      SegFaulting (I drowned in DicomDir related code when trying to
      understand why the list is empty...).
    * src/gdcmDocument.h: first BSD license header try.
    * Doc/License.txt added.

2004-06-15 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
    * src/gdcmDocument.[h|cxx]:
      - Clean up of the Transfer related predicates. They are now all based
        on new method isGivenTransferSyntax, that (should) handle properly
        the padding problem.
      - general clean up, simplification, and coding style.
      - Specific clean up of Parse7FE0() (umproperly named actually).
    * gdcmPython/testSuite.py: an odd temporary kludge introduced.

2004-06-14 Jean-Pierre Roux		
   *  gdcmSeqEntry.cxx
	   - fix the display of Sequence Delimitor (SQDepthLevel pb)
		- fix the display of SQItem ordinal number
      - add the GetSQItemByOrdinalNumber method
		- remove some useless never written private methods	
		
2004-06-14 Jean-Pierre Roux
   * gdcmBinEntry.cxx 
      - adding a constructor taking a gdcmDocEntry as an input param
	   - ReplaceOrCreateByNumber now returns :
	      a gdcmBinEntry * if a Binary (void *) value is passed as a param
		   a gdcmValEntry * if a string value is passed as a param
   * dcmDocument.cxx
      - SetEntryByNumber now allows setting gdcmValEntry or gdcmBinEntry, 
	      according to the param type (no longer sets a gdcmDocEntry)
	   - GetValEntryByNumber, GetBinEntryByNumber added
      - NewValEntryByNumber and NewBinEntryByNumber added
   * gdcmFile.cxx
      - Pixel Data are now linked to the (7fe0,0010) elements, after reading
   * gdcmSQItem.h
      - GetSQItemNumber and SetSQItemNumber added, to provide 
            a (relative) Item identier inside a given Sequence
            \warning : some pb remaining around this number
				will be solved asap
      - AddEntry now takes the Item Number as a param 	
   * gdcmValEntry.cxx 
      - adding a constructor taking a gdcmDocEntry as an input param

    * Memory leak hunt with the following command:
      valgrind --leak-check=yes --leak-resolution=high --num-callers=40
               --show-reachable=yes gdcmTests PrintDocument
      It looks like many (all?) leaks are due to the STL (or a bad usage
      of the STL. The lines producing the leaks now have a comment with
      a "MEMORY LEAK" tag: you can retrieve them with 
          grep "MEMORY LEAK" src/*
      Here are two typical examples which I can't help fixing:
      -----
          #include <string>
          int main() {
             std::string name;
             char * test = "babo";
             name = test;    //// <--- valgrind detects 960 bytes lost in
                             ////   call to std::string::operator=(char const*)
             name.clear();   //// Doesn't help !
             return 0;
          }
      -----
          #include <string>
          #include <iostream>
          int main() {
             std::string line;
             std::cout << "Type a bunch of characters followed by RETURN: ";
             getline(std::cin, line);   //// <--- valgrind dectects a loss
                                        //// of 1320 bytes in call to
                                        /// std::basic_istream<>& std::getline<>
            return 0;
          }
      -----


2004-06-10 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
    * src/gdcmHeader.[cxx|h]:
      - Predicates on the Transfer syntax (of the form Is[JPEG|RLE]*)
        and related, moved away to gdcmDocument.
      - Accessors (on the form [Get|Set]Entry*) set up to expose publicly
        the corresponding protected accessors of inherited class
        gdcmDocument, removed ! As a consequence gdcmFile had to be 
        declared friend of class gdcmDocument (see below).
      - operator< moved to gdcmDocument (in fact it belongs to gdcmDicomDir).
      - Clean up of undefined or unused methods.
    * src/gdcmFile.[cxx|h]: added SetEntryByNumber (in order to take into
      account the changes to gdcmHeader.h).
    * src/gdcmDocument.h:
      - gdcmFile is now a friend class (in order to take into account the
        changes to gdcmHeader.h).
      - Predicates on the Transfer syntax (of the form Is[JPEG|RLE]*) added
        (see changes to gdcmHeader.h).
      - Accessors (reading on the form GetEntry*) are now public.
      - Clean up of undefined or unused methods.
    * src/gdcmDocument.cxx:
      - adaptation to changes to gdcmDocument.h
      - ::OpenFile now writes a verbose message when file cannot be opened.
      - some std::string properly set to VRKey
    * src/gdcmDicomDir.h: historical references to gdcmHeader changed to
      references to gdcmDocument. 
    * Test/TestFindTags.cxx: changed accordingly to above changes.
    * gdcmPython/testSuite.py: adapted to renaming of acr files in 
      cvs repository gdcmData.

2004-06-09 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
    * src/gdcmValEntry.h: member voidArea type changed from char* to void*.
    * src/gdcmBinEntry.h: member voidArea commented out, since it potentially
      conflicts with gdcmValEntry::voidArea.
    * src/gdcmValEntry.cxx: unmatching comment wiped out.
    * src/gdcmVR.[h|cxx]: added two predicates that partition the possible
      Value representation between StringRepresentable and BinaryRepresentable.
    * src/gdcmDocument.cxx: 
      - method ParseDES: proper indentation restored and usage of
        gdcmVR::IsVROfGdcmStringRepresentable wired in.
      - method LoadDocEntry: the fingerprint left in the SetValue() of
        unloaded entries (length > MaxSizeLoadEntry) had curiously been
        removed. Reverting to previous code segment with the proper
        dynamic_cast< gdcmValEntry* >.
        Note: this was (partially) breaking the python test suite
              (gdcmPython/testSuite.py) that made usage of the above
              fingerprint to check presence of "Pixel Data".
    * src/gdcmDocEntry.h: coding style.
    * gdcmPython/__init__.py: environement variable GDCM_DATA_PATH is
      now taken into account.
    * gdcmPython/gdcm.i: adaptation to the new internal representation
      of gdcm (exit gdcmParser, hello gdcmDocument).
    * gdcmPython/testSuite.py: quick and dirty fix for loading vtkgdcmPython
      on posix.
    * gdcmPython/demo/PrintHeader.py: doesn't use the gdcmDocument::Print()
      anymore, but instead prints the loaded Python dictionary.
    * .... alas, the python testSuite is still broken.

2004-05-18 Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
    * gdcmPython/gdcm.i : remove useless lines concerning the gdcmGlobal
      gdcmGlob
    * gdcmPython/setup.py : replace the use of cvar.gdcmGlob to gdcmGlobal
    * src/gdcmUtil.h : export methods

2004-05-16  Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
    * Some more cleanup/enhancement in gdcmPython/CMakeLists.txt getting close
      to right behavior
    * Initial addition of automatic python testing
    * Initial addition of automatic image comparison

2004-05-04 Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
    * src/gdcmCommon.h, gdcmDicomDir.cxx, gdcmFile.cxx, gdcmHeaderHelper.h,
      gdcmParser.cxx, gdcmParser.h : bug fix for the Microsoft .Net compilation

2004-05-04 Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
     * src/gdcmFile.cxx, gdcmHeader.cxx : bug fix for the msvc compilation
     * Test/ShowDicom.cxx : bug fix for msvc compilation
     * vtk/vtkgdcmViewer.cxx : bug fix for msvc compilation

2004-05-04 Jean-Pierre Roux
     * ADD Taking into account the 'Dicom Sequences' leads up to introduce
       new concepts (and new classes) :
       a 'gdcmDocument' is composed of a set of Doc Entries, that are
        - elementary gdcmDocEntries (former gdcmHeaderEntries)
        - Sequence Doc Entries (gdcmSeqEntries)
       a Sequence is composed of Items.
       Each item is a set of Doc Entries (this is recursive)
       The non uniqueness of the 'Dicom tag' is due to this recursivity
       (never taken into account)
       Our unability to add a new 'entry' in the header
       at the proper location (neither in the H-Table (map or multimap),
       nor in the Chained List is also due to this recursivity.
       Don't try, right now, to use/modify/compile these new sources :
       nothing is finished.
       We just commit all the stuff, 'as is', in order not to loose it.

2004-05-04 Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
     * vtk/vtkGdcmReader.cxx : bug fix in the setting of file name
     
2004-05-03 Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
     * vtk/vtkGdcmReader.cxx : bug fix when loading a list of files using the
       file prefix (SetFilePrefix)

2004-05-02  Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
     * Add a new test: ShowDicom, for now this is just the c++ version of
       checkRead.sh, later it will be able to compare the image read against a
       baseline.
     * Replace the DEBUG on the stack with a global entry in cmake interface:
       GDCM_DEBUG, so you can turn verbosity ON/OFF for debug statement.

2004-04-30  Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
     * Add an example subdir, with a real example on how to read + write a 
       dicom image

2004-04-30  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
     * Doc/gdcmUML.xmi added raw UML class view (umbrello format)
     * Doc/CMakeLists.txt: the main page is now properly differentiated
       between the developper and user version.
     * Doc/doxygen.config.in: dropped search related obsolete flags
     * src/gdcmParser.h, gdcmHeader.h: doxygenation

2004-04-29  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
     * DEVELOPPER: added some helpfull comments for compile/test/install
       when using cmake.

2004-04-29  Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
     * ENH: 1. Remove remp solution of gdcmTests.cxx+ gdcmMain directly in 
               src directory, now generated in the build dir.
            2. Tests as mentionned smarter
            3. Some clean up
            4. Add a new method in gdcmDict that return the PubDict by name 
          this is interesting for 3rd party lib like ITK, 
          where we could set the institution name / patient name...

       * ENH: 1. Now the test suite is working for real
              2. All binaries are now output in the gdcm-bin directory 
                 (this was not true before)

2004-04-28  Jean-Pierre Roux
     * ENH add the provisional  gdcmHeader::SQDepthLevel to allow 
           SeQuence indented printing of Dicom Header.
     * ENH merge methods gdcmParser::Parse and gdcmParser::LoadHeaderEntries
           into the single gdcmParser::LoadHeaderEntries for efficiency purpose.
	   Computation of SQDepthLevel is now part of gdcmHeader constructor
     * ENH add self defined param 'new' to PrintHeader to 'show' the SeQuence
           tree-like structure of a Dicom Header.
     * FIX Test code cleaning     
           
2004-04-25  Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
     * ENH: Adding automatic testing
       1. Need a DartConfig.cmake to submit to public
       2. Add a test driver gdcmTest.cxx
       3. gdcmTestMain, an helper for the main test driver gdcmTest
       4. Files in Test don't have a main anymore, this becomes interesting 
          when we add more and more tests, thus dsw don't have to load 
          too many projects
     * ENH: Adding a GDCM_DATA_ROOT for testing
     * ENH: Remove redundancie about GDCM_DICT stuff, now we only need to modify
       one file instead of seven + some small cleanup

2004-04-22  Jean-Pierre Roux
     * ENH Minor changes to the Print() methods.
     * ADD gdcmParser::PrintEntryNiceSQ() to allow SQ-indented
           Header printing. Example given with :
	   > PrintHeader fileName  2 new
          (SQ based tree-like structure still to be done for the Header ...)
	   
2004-04-22  Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
     * ENH: Some cosmetic clean up for compilation with -W -Wall -Werror
         1. I have added some unsigned where needed
         2. Some function parameter not used -> (void)
         3. In gdcmDicomDir.cxx, add GDCM_DICOMDIR_NONE case
         4. g++ don't like character '\' in comment
         5. #define jpeg_create_decompress  jCreaDecompress
                    this really need to be fixed
         6. virtualize destructor of gdcmObject ... leakage
         7. sscanf(g->first.c_str(),"%x",&gr_bid); 
                    this also really need to be fixed
         8. gdcm/src/jpeg/libijg8/CMakeLists.txt, 
                    remove compression file 
                    (as we only do decompression, right ?)     
     * ENH: Change malloc/calloc/free with c++ equivalent

2004-04-21  Jean-Pierre Roux
     * FIX gdcmHeaderHelper::GetXSpacing
           when a single value is found (bug ?), xpacing is now 
           defaulted to yspacing
	   
2004-04-19  Jean-Pierre Roux
     * ADD gdcmData/Wrist.pap (PAPYRUS 3.0 -single frame-) for checking purpose
     * ENH add parameters :
               bool  exception_on_error = false, 
               bool  enable_sequences   = false,
	       bool  ignore_shadow      = false
           to the gdcmFile constructors to be full gdcmParser compliant
     * FIX vtk/vtkGdcmReader.cxx now uses  enable_sequences = true in gdcmFile
           to allow reading of PAPYRUS 3.0 files 
	      
2004-04-06  Jean-Pierre Roux
     * ADD gdcmData/E00001S03I0015.dcm for SQ checking purpose
     
2004-04-02  Jean-Pierre Roux
     * ADD : Test/checksequence.sh, for a general recap on SQ pb

             for Philips spurious Tag fffe|0000 while rewritting Dicom files
	     
2004-03-30  Jean-Pierre Roux
     * FIX gdcmParser::ReplaceOrCreateByNumber shouldn't seg fault any more 
         for ACR file, written out as DICOM files (hope so...)

2004-03-30  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
     * src/gdcmParser.[cxx|h] and gdcmHeader.[cxx.h]: gdcmHeader::Write split
       in WriteEntryTagVRLength and WriteEntryValue. Those methods were
       moved to base class gdcmParser and only the specialisation is kept
       in gdcmHeader.
     * src/gdcmParser.[cxx|h]: ReplaceOrCreateByNumber(char*, guint16, guint16)
       trashed out (because ReplaceOrCreateByNumber(string, guint16, guint16)
       already does the job.
     * src/gdcmDicomDir.[cxx|h]: WriteDicomDirEntries renamed to WriteEntries
       (to be consistent with gdcmParser::WriteEntries).

2004-03-30 Benoit Regrain
     * vtk/vtkGdcmReader.[h|cxx] : fix the read of 3 gdcmHeader when making an
       upate of the object's instance. It's passed to 2 in the unfavorable
       case : one in the ExecuteInformation, one in the ExecuteData

2004-03-29  Jean-Pierre Roux
     * ENH : Check on file type to be written moved
             from gdcmParser::WriteEntry to gdcmParser::WriteEntries
     * FIX : gdcmObject::ResetBoundaries now stops properly
             when end-of-list is reached
	   : gdcmVersion modified (as Benoit Regrain asked)

2004-03-29  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
     * src/gdcmParser.cxx: removal of all TAB character. Indentation fixed.
     * src/gdcmUtil.cxx: added forgotten iostream include.
     * src/gdcmCommon.h: FileType enum entry DICOMDIR removed (since
       equivalent to ExplicitVR in existing code).

2004-03-27  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
     * src/gdcmUtil.[cxx|h] split in two. Additional file gdcmGlobal.[cxx|h]

     * minor coding style and doxygenation changes.

2004-03-26  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
     * src/gdcmUtil.[cxx|h] split in two. Additional file gdcmDebug.[cxx|h]
       now contains all the Debug related code.
     * minor clean-up of includes in src/*.cxx
     * src/gdcmUtil.[cxx|h] _cleanString C style function (replaced with
       CreateCleanString) removed.
     * src/gdcmUtil.[cxx|h] _CreateCleanString renamed to CreateCleanString
     * Doc/DoxyMainPageUser.txt added.
     * Doc/Doc/DoxyfileUsers updated to version 1.3.4 of Doxygen.
     * src/gdcmCommon.h now defines getcwd for Win32 (moved away from
       src/gdcmDirList.cxx)

2004-03-24  Jean-Pierre Roux
     * FIX a lot of little surface modifications to be doxygen 1.3.6 compliant

2004-03-23  Jean-Pierre Roux
     * FIX Now gdcmFile::SwapZone doesn't seg faults any longer for
           big endian made volumes
     * ENH Now gdcmParser constructor and destructor are protected to forbid
           end user to instanciate class gdcmParser
          (only gdcmHeader and gdcmDicomDir are meaningfull)

2004-03-22 Benoit Regrain
     * FIX : src/gdcmDicomDir.cxx : make windows compilable
     * FIX : gdcmPython/gdcm.i : change gdcmStudy to gdcmDicomDirStudy and
             gdcmSerie to gdcmDicomDirSerie

2004-03-19  Jean-Pierre Roux
     * ENH Now the tree-like structure describing a DICOMDIR comming from
           an already existing DICOMDIR file is consistent with
           the home-made tree-like structure build ex-nihilo
           or build from the files held (recursively) in a Directory
           functions gdcmDicomDir::CheckBoundaries()
           gdcmObject::SetBoundaries() added

2004-03-17  Jean-Pierre Roux
     * REM (Eric Boix bug) : removal of meaningless
                             gdcmDicomDirImage::NewImage function.
     * FIX now file names and directory name are written properly in the
           DICOMDIR
     * FIX now gdcmDicomDir constructor may be call without any trick
           about the name

2004-03-16  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
     * FIX (JPR bug) : src/gdcmDicomDirImage.cxx added missing definition
                       of gdcmDicomDirImage::NewImage as empty function.

2004-02-28  Jean-Pierre Roux
     * ENH add gdcmDicomDir:NewPatient

           add gdcmDicomDirSerie:NewImage
	   to allow making gdcDicomDir object.
     * ADD PrintDicomDir executable that uses gdcmDicomDir tree-like structure
          (as opposite to the gdcmHeader chained list)

2004-02-11 Benoit Regrain
     * FIX : memory leaks and the set of ArgDelete methods in gdcmDicomDir
             when using from python

             - GDCM_META added to gdcmDicomDirType
             - class gdcmMeta created
     * ENH : - A brief summary is now displayed at the beginning of
             'testDicomDir' to help disaster magnitude estimation
     * REM : Now useless Test/explDICOMDIR.cxx

2004-02-05 Benoit Regrain

     * FIX handling 'non string elements' unsecure area (LUT, overlays, etc)
     * FIX Dicts/dicomV3.dic : Add a few missing 'group length' Elements 
     * FIX gdcmParser.cxx : 'group length' elements are now considered 
           as integers, even for shadow groups, when file is Implicit VR
        
2004-02-02 Jean-Pierre Roux
     * FIX : gdcmWrite : equal_range() for multimap doesn't return a 'second' 
             iterator on last

     * FIX taking into account the possible 7fe0,0010 multiplicity        
     * FIX add GRPixel,NumPixel,countGrPixel (gdcmParser protected members)
           to allow removal of references to 7fe0,0010, to deal with
      ACR-NEMA images, when 0028,0200 is meaningfull

2004-01-31 Jean-Pierre Roux
     * FIX gdcmParser::WriteEntries : when a VR is tagged as 'Unknown'
           no longer writes 'Un' on disk
     * FIX SQ elements with actual length are now dealt with corectly
     * FIX gdcmFile::WriteBase make the difference, for color images, between
           the length (for Palette expanded images)
           and Raw Length (non expanded image + Palette)
     * FIX Dicts/dicomV3.dic : removal of 'CTX' (context dependant) VR
           (that broke Write). Replaced by UL.
           Aware user will reload the field if he 
           thinks it's necesssary
             
2004-01-30 Jean-Pierre Roux
     * gdcmParser::CheckSwap() now defaults the filetype to ACR 
       when 'dirty Acr' is found, to be compliant with the new 
       IsReadable() methods.
       
     * gdcmHeaderHelper :add Pixel Type 'FD', for dealing with 'double' images.
      (no DOUBLE images in kosher DICOM, 
      but so usefull for people that miss them ;-)
      
     * add Test/testDicomDir.cxx, Test/makeDicomDir.cxx , Test/explDICOMDIR.cxx
       DICOMDIR related utilities (not checked as Windoze compliant)

2004-01-28 Jean-Pierre Roux
     * upgrade GdcmHeaderEntry Print Method for DICOMDIR

2004-01-27 Jean-Pierre Roux
     * gdcmParser constructor has a new boolean param,'ignore_shadow', 
             to allow skipping the shadow elements, to save memory space.
        The TRUE value for this param has to be used 
        with a FALSE value for the 'enable_sequence' param.
        ('public elements' may be embedded in 'shadow Sequences')
     * gdcmHeader methods now deal with 'embedded icones images' in the header
             (even when an 'icone image sequence' is announced by the 
        element (0x0088,0x0200), but there is NO icone at all ...
        
     * gdcmHeader sometimes Image Location value doesn't follow  
             the supposed processor endianity (see gdcmData/cr172241.dcm).
             Fixed

     * gdcmHeader add the method
             IterHT  GetHeaderEntrySameNumber(grPixel,numPixel);
        to get *all* the Header Entries with the same tag.
        GetHeaderEntrySameName is probabely *useless* 
        (no meaning : Name is *not* an identifier within the Dictionnary)

2004-01-26 Benoit Regrain
     * Bug fix in the print of hexadecimal representations. Remove long fields 
       in the print and add a third level of print to print them

2004-01-23 Benoit Regrain
     * Bug fix on field having a VR = 'UI'. Assume that is a string field
     * Bug fix on test suite after remove the strip made on not string fields
     * Split the IsReadable method between gdcmParser which test that the file
       is dicom and gdcmHeader which test that it's an image file

2004-01-19 Benoit Regrain
     * removal of file gdcmHeader2.cxx
     * split class gdcmHeader into gdcmParser and gdcmHeader, with gdcmHeader
       inheriting from gdcmParser. This split is to prepare the integration
       of dicom dir parsing
     * bug fix under python

2004-01-16 Jean-Pierre Roux
    * REM removal of class gdcmHeaderEntrySet
    * REM removal of files gdcmHeaderEntrySet.cxx, gdcmHeaderEntrySet.h

2004-01-15 Benoit Regrain
     * src/gdcmDicSet.[h|cxx] : add virtual entries to have a reference of
       entries created while parsing the header. Thus, they will be destroyed
       when the gdcmDictSet will be destroyed
     * src/gdcmHeader.cxx, gdcmHeaderEntrySet.cxx : uses virtual entries of
       gdcmDictSet

2004-01-15 Benoit Regrain
     * vtk/vtkGdcmReader.cxx : bug fix : before, with python only, the program
       made a fatal error because of the memory release at the end of program.
       The problem was in vtkGdcmReader::ExecuteData where we were allocate
       some memory and vtk seems to have some problems with that.
     * src/gdcmHeaderEntrySet.cxx : bug fix for std lib and cout

2004-01-14 Benoit Regrain
     * src/gdcmHeaderEntry.[h|cxx] : gdcmElValue -> gdcmHeaderEntry
     * src/gdcmHeaderEntrySet.[h|cxx] : gdcmElValSet -> gdcmHeaderEntrySet
     * src/*.[h|cxx] : make changes due to class name changes

2004-01-13 Benoit Regrain
     * gdcmPython/testSuite.py : test the readable flag of file for tests
     * src/gdcmDict.cxx, gdcmElValSet.cxx : bug fix under windows for prints.
       It's lied to the stl compilation by MSVC (windows, always windows...)
     * src/gdcmIdo.h, gdcmHeaderIdo.cxx : remove the Ido unused files

2004-01-12 Benoit Regrain
     * src/*.h : add comments
     * src/gdcmDictSet.h : set the method BuildDictPath in public
     * src/gdcmTS.cxx, gdcmVR.cxx : use now a dictionnary file other than to be
       directly setted in the source code
     * Dicts/dicomTS.dic, dicomVR.dic : 2 new dictionnary files loaded by
       gdcmTS and gdcmVR

2004-01-09 Benoit Regrain
     * gdcmPython/gdcmVersion.py : add a gdcmVERSION variable information
     * setup.py : use a reference to gdcmVERSION

2004-01-07 Benoit Regrain
     * Modification to compile with the distutils.
     * Bug fix in code

2003-12-10 Benoit Regrain
     * gdcmHeader is now aggregating gdcmFile, and not derived into. Thus, we
       can use a gdcmHeaderHelper to load datas
     * gdcmPython/testSuite.py : make the testSuite compliant with modifications
       made in the source code

2003-12-10 Benoit Regrain
     * Update Windows projects and .cvsignore files

2003-11-12 Jean-Pierre Roux
     * ENH gdcmHeader constructor has one more parameter (default value : false)
           that allows the user to 'go inside' the SeQuences only
           if he wants to.
           gdcmElValSet:Print takes it into account

2003-11-12  Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
     * ENH: Update gdcmPython/CMakeLists
     * FIX: (gdcmHeaderHelper) GetRescale and GetSlope
     * FIX: (gdcmElValSet) char 'tag' was overiding private members (VC++)

2003-11-10 Jean-Pierre Roux
      * FIX : gdcmHeader::LoadElements is now based
             on the ListTag listElem member,
             not longer on the TagElValueHT tagHt member
      * ENH : PrintPubElVal shows (temporarily) both results,
             with the tagHt member and the listElem member.
	     (it's easier to 'see' the problems when using Printheader)

      * FIX : old private member LgrElem is now splitted into
             ReadLength   : Length actually found on disk (updated only
	                    if bug fixing is necessary), for internal
			    use only
	     UsableLength : Updated by FixFoundLength, to fix a bug
	                    or to allow Parser going on.
	     Will allow to re-write a kosher header when a SeQuence
	     with a length (not 0000) is found
      Warning : gdcmFile::Write still uses the TagHt (not ListElem)
	        because gdcmElValSet::Add does not update ListElem
		(to be written)

2003-11-07 Jean-Pierre Roux
     * FIX misstyping in Transfert Syntax name table
     * ENH gdcmHeader::FixFoundLength now allow to 'go inside' tge SeQuences
          when they have an actual length (not 0000 nor FFFFF)
     (Nobody should care of it, but DICOMDIR explorers)

2003-11-06  Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>

     * in testSuite.py : new files names for checking the package
     * FIX : Forgot to commit gdcmFile::GetImageDataSizeRaw();
             that returns the pixel area size to the *aware* (vtk) user
             that DOESN'T want to turn the PALETTE COLOR image into an RGB image

2003-11-05 Benoit Regrain
     * in testSuite.py : Modify the rules for checking the paths

     * GetPixelType now returns 8U for 24 Bits images
                    (vtkGdcmReader compliant)           
      
2003-10-31 Jean-Pierre Roux
     * Removal of *all* gdcmData images and add them again

                               gdcmFile::GetImageDataIntoVectorRaw
             that act as GetImageData and GetImageDataIntoVector
             except the making of an RGB Plane from Gray Plane + LUT
             Intended to aware (vtk) users who know how to manage
             such an image :
             After gdcmHeader :
              GetLUTRGBA return a R,G,B,A LUT if any
              lgrTotaleRaw gives the 'Raw' length
              GetImageDataRaw returns the gray Plane
     * FIX : no more dirty trick for 'Segmented xxx Palette Color Lookup' images
             (They stay Grey, just like with other Dicom viewers :-(

2003-10-30 Jean-Pierre Roux

      * src/*.cxx removed pragma thingies to src/gdcmCommon.h
        Two reasons: - clear things
                     - third parties acces gdcm through header files, so won't
                       suffer anymore VC++ complains

2003-09-30  Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * add argv[1] in testvtkGdcmReader.cxx
      * removed leaks

2003-09-24 Jean-Pierre Roux
      * The lines are now eigthy characters long.for 
        gdcmHeader.cxx gdcmHeaderHelper.cxx gdcmParse.cxx 

2003-09-22  Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmUtil.[cxx|h] : change the _CreateCleanString return value from
        char* to std::string. Thus, the use of strdup becomes useless. (see
        previous commis of Malaterre)
      * src/gdcmElValSet.cxx : reuse commented call to _CreateCleanString like
        before the last Malaterre's commit.

2003-09-19  Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * This commit should fix the Debug building under VC++, the problem
        was mainly a mixture of debug and release lib being loaded at startup.
      * I also remove a depency to a specific C function: strdup. Because I had
        to force the link to msvcrtd (whereas strdup is in libc).

2003-09-16  Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * "gdcm::Unfound" string changed to a constant variable (GDCM_UNFOUND)
        located in the gdcmCommon.h file. All use of reference of tha has been
        changed to now use the variable GDCM_UNFOUND.

2003-09-16  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr> with JPR
      * Cosmetic changes:
        - gdcmPython/testSuite.py adapted to the JPR updated Dicts/dicomV3.dic
          Dicom dictionary. The test suite can now be run again. Note:
          I'm note very happy with the " (RET)" changes. I believe this
          RETAINED comment should be dropped when parsing the dictionary.
        - PACKAGER corrected
        - DEVELOPPER added.
        - AUTHORS updated and now in alphabetical order
      * Makefile.am now exports gdcm.dsw for Windoze users.

2003-09-11  Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * cygwin complains about missing std:: in subdir Test/

2003-09-10  Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * remove some methods that are now in gdcmHeaderHelper

2003-09-10  Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * vtkGdcmReader set spacing and origin correctly

2003-09-09  Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * Fix a few delete/delete[] mismatch

2003-09-08  Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmHeaderHelper.[h cxx]: added new class that provide an
        interpretation to data given by gdcmHeader. For instance there are
        heuristics to get informations (look at different places).
      * it also include a specific class: gdcmSerieHeaderHelper devoted to
        sorting DICOM images based on different strategies.
      * modified Makefiles accordingly.

2003-09-05  Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/*.cxx : added pragma disable 4786/4251 to get rid of ~4300 warning
        when building in debug mode
      * vtk/win32/vtkgdcm.dsp : change /MT -> /MD and /MTd -> /MDd to match
        src/win32/gdcmdll.dsp
      * vtk/win32/vtkgdcm.dsp : added /nodefaultlib "mscvrt" for debug mode

2003-08-29  Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * Corrected a leak in vtkGdcmREader.cxx, the pSource was find thanks
            to valgrind.

2003-07-29  Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/win32/libgdcmjpeg12.dsp was not dos format
      * src/win32/libgdcmjpeg12.dsp : 
                  libgdcmijpeg12_EXPORTS -> LIBGDCMIJPEG12_EXPORTS
      * src/win32/gdcmdll.dsp: + /I "..\jpeg\libijg12"

2003-07-29 Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmHeader.h : add std:: prefix for stl elements... like others in
        the file
      * src/gdcmFile.cxx : bug fix in affectation type
      * src/jpeg/libijpeg12/jmorecfg12.h : export for windows modified... like

      * Modifs of MVSC projects to compile them. Not concerning 2 identic
        symbols... future problem ?

2003-07-29  Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/win32/libgdcmijpeg12.dsp was missing
      * modified gdcm.dsw accordingly

2003-07-28  Mathieu Malaterre  <Mathieu.Malaterre@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx : misplaced return 0.; for ACR/NEMA

2003-07-24 Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/jpeg/libijg12/.cvsignore, jconfig.* : ommited files while last
        commit of JPR (before his hollidays to facilitate our work).
      * setup.py : bug fix in code. Modifications made while the last commit
        of JPR. The code hasn't been tested before the commit... it's so
        useless to make that (for best programmer that is JPR) !!!

2003-07-08  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * tagged the current version as Version0_3 (i.e. version 0.3)

2003-07-08  Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * vtk/testvtkGdcmReader.cxx : remove a symbol that is unused

2003-07-07  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmElValSet.cxx, gdcmFile.cxx: JPR bug fix, removal of
        garbage debug code.
      * TODO, vtk/vtkGdcmReader.cxx: upcoming fixes comments.
      * gdcmPython/testSuite.py: JPR bug fix, brutal erasement of
        test suite reported error.
      * PACKAGER file added (describes what a packager must do when
        packaging a new release).
      * MANIFEST.in, now declares jconfig.linux and jconfig.vc
      * configure.in: upgraded version number to 0.3.0
      * fixing build of rpm (through rpm -ta):
        - Doc/Makefile.am exports proper doxygen files
        - src/jpeg/libijg8/Makefile.am exports the include files.

2003-07-07  Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * vtk/vtkGdcmReader.cxx : bug fix when loading only 1 file.
      * src/gdcmHeader.h : formatting code

2003-07-07  Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * vtk/vtkGdcmReader.[cxx|h] : bug fix when loading only one file.
        We were obtaining error message from vtk. Now, creation of file list
        is made in an internal list to prevent this problem.
        Bug fix when output is empty.
        Bug fix in update of progress value. Previous commit for this was a bad
        correction.
      * vtk/vtkGdcmReader.h : adding comments for InternalFileNaleList variable

2003-07-04  Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmHeader.h : added method to get the file name
      * vtk/vtkGdcmReader.[cxx|h] : bug fix concerning loading of bad dicom
        files. Added method to remove all files on the input
        Added FIXME comment concerning the bad parsing of header made by
        ExecuteInformation method (in ExecuteData method)

2003-07-03  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * vtk/Makefile.am: vtkGdcmReader.h should now be cleany installed
        when using make instal.
      * src/gdcmFile.cxx : bug fix under Window after JPR commit
        RQ : the JPR doesn't appear in the ChangeLog... normal for him

2003-07-03  Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * setup.py : adding include dir of jpeg lib to compile all sources
      * */Win32/*.dsp : JPR fix for windows compilation

2003-07-02  Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/jpeg/libijg8/jconfig.* : JPR bug fix : now compile on both
        linux and WINDOWS !
      * src/gdcmJpeg.cxx : JPR bug fix : erroneous include
      * src/win32/gdcmdll.dsp : JPR fix for windows compilation

2003-07-02  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * setup.py is again effective on un*x (takes into account the
        addon of the jpeg library)
      * Doc/DoxyDevelInstal.txt added (developper's raw documentation)
      * Doc/Doxy* updated (includes above enhancements)
      * INSTALL now points to web documentation

2003-07-01  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmHeader.h doesn't make unnecessary reference to
        gdcmUtil.h anymore.
      * gdcmPython/Makefile.am now avoids calling the wrappers for the
        clean target.
      * src/gdcm*.[cxx|h] :
        - to allow compilation with gcc 3.x
          -- clean up of STL usage (added explicit usage of std::)
          -- small fixes on exceptions.
          Note: linking not tested !
        - clean of doxygen comments to avoid warnings at documentation
          building stage.
      * vtk/vtkGdcmReader.cxx: g++ warning message clean up (platform
        dependent convertion).

2003-06-20  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * Clean up of previous JPR garbage commit (not even commented in the
        Changelog):
        - Test/Makefile.am removed the reference to unexisting testTS.cxx
        - moved all jpeg related files from src to src/jpeg/libijg8, with
          addition/modification of Makefile.am and configure.in.
        - the testSuite is still brain damage (not guilty).

2003-06-02  Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * WrapVTK.py : modifications to get correctly vtk source files to
        compile
      * vtk/vtkGdcmReader.cxx : modification for an already existing name
        (FileName -> Filename)

2003-06-11  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * vtk/vtkGdcmReader.[cxx/h]:
        - UpdateProgress method should now be effective
        - removed the limitation on having only images loaded (as opposed
          to volumes),
        - when building a stack of images/volume, a lesser number of
          gdcmHeader and gdcmFile instances should be used (hopefully
          accelerating things).
        - when building a stack of images/volumes, files which are not
          loadable (wrong path-filename, wrong permissions on existing file,
          or file not parsable by gdcm) are replaced with a black image
          in the stack (for the caller to notice the problem).

2003-06-03  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * vtk/vtkGdcmReader.cxx: hopefully corrected Z extent.

2003-06-02  Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * vtk/vtkGdcmReader[cxx|h] : makes correct code to remove conflicts
        between standard library (std) and vtk library (problems are found
        under Windows... thanks Windows !)

2003-05-30  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * vtk/vtkGdcmReader[cxx|h] should now be volume aware (read ready for
        debug stage).
      * gdcmPython/demo/vtkGdcmReader.py: commented lines for volume test

2003-05-29  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * vtk/vtkGdcmReader[cxx|h] preparation addons for loading volumes.

2003-05-28  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * When compiling with distutils (see setup.py) the C++ compiler is
        called with different flags than the default ones (with automake).
        In order to fix all those warning, I compiled gdcm with the command
           make 'CXXFLAGS=-Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -D__STDC_LIMIT_MACROS'
        and went for warning fixes:
        - src/gdcmHeader.cxx, Test/dcm2acr.cxx, pourFindTaggs.cxx cleaned
          up from unused variables.
        - vtk/vtkGdcmReader.cxx: potential bug fix.
      * src/gdcmHeader.h: Doxygen warning cleanup

2003-05-27  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * gdcmPython/gdcm.i:
        - typemaps correction to take into account the systematic replacement
          of "using namespace std" with std:: prefix e.g. std::list,
          std::string... (cf changes of 2003-05-21).
        - gdcmGlob global variable of type gdcmGlobal (defined in
          src/gdcmUtil.cxx and declared in gdcmPython/gdcm.i) is now
          exported to Python a as cvar.
      * gdcmPython/__init__.py now defines two functions GetPubDictTagNames()
        and GetPubDictTagNamesByCategory() as a replacement for deprecated
        gdcmDictSet.GetPubDictTagNames() and
        gdcmDictSet.GetPubDictTagNamesByCategory() class functions (i.e.
        C++ static methods).
      * gdcmPython/demo/printGroupedPublicDict.py is operational again,
        with the above changes.

2003-05-22  Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * setup.py, manifest.in : bug fix under linux

2003-05-22  Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * Modification of setup.py to compile vtk part too. Then, we have 2
        wrappers which must work with same distutils. For that, we have a
        generic distutils in distusiltsWrapping.py ; with :
         - build_extWrap class to wrap generically all extensions,
         - ExtensionWrap base class for all wrapping extension that contains
           a wrapper
         - Wrapper interface which wrap sources
        + In WrapSwig.py  we have extension and wrapper for Swig
        + In WrapVTK.py  we have extension and wrapper for VTK
      * MANIFEST.in : modifications to consider vtk directory and new python
        files for compilation

2003-05-21  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr> with Benoit Regrain
      * Added python wrappers of vtkGdcmReader vtk class (see the
        source in vtk/vtkGdcmReader.cxx) :
        - vtk/Makefile.am now builds a library
        - gdcmPython/Makefile.am now builds vtkgdcmPython a second import
          python library (as opposed to _gdcm.so wich are the python
          wrappers of gdcm). vtkgdcmPython.so uses the vtk python wrappers
          (vtkWrapPython and vtkWrapPythonInit utility) to build vtkgdcmPython
          import library.
        - configure.in has an additional flag --enable-vtk that needs
          to be set to enable compilation of vtk related code, that is:
          + vtk/vtkGdcmReader.so and
          + vtk/testvtkGdcmReader C++ demo of vtk wrappers of gdcm)
          + gdcmPython/vtkgdcmPython.so (see above)
        - gdcmPython/demo/vtkGdcmDemo.py corrected (some images cannot
          be read when compressed or when HighBit + 1 != BitsStored),
        - gdcmPython/demo/vtkGdcmReader.py added. This demo illustrates
          the usage of the python wrapper of vtkGdcmReader vtk class.
      * vtk/vtkGdcmReader.cxx: bug fixed (thanks to Benoit Regrain).
      * src/*.[h] all occurences of stl classes are now prefixed with
        std::, and all occurences of "using namespace std;" where removed.
        This is to avoid pollution of global namespace in included files.
        Apparently vtk does not avoid this pitfall: when using both
        gdcm and vtk (as in vtk/vtkGdcmReader.cxx) this ended up in a
        collision of various stl members (principally cout...).
      * gdcmPython/testSuite.py now cleanly removes temprory generated
        file.
      * gdcmPython/gdcm.i now declares a typemap for std::string (to
        comply with above changes)

2003-05-12  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr> with JPR
      * src/gdcmHeader>[h/cxx] added gdcmHeader::GetPixelSize()
      * vtk/vtkGdcmReader.cxx now properly inports the image in the
        vtk data structure (an image Flip was required).
      * vtk/testvtkGdcmReader.cxx refers to gdcmData subdir instead of Data.
      * cosmetic changes in documentation.

2003-05-7  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr> with JPR
      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx: the constructor no longer exits when an
        unexisting file is given as argument.
      * The subdirectory Data (containing all the images used for the
        test suite) is not part of this repository anymore. A new module
        containing those images is now available at
          :pserver:xxx@cvs.creatis.insa-lyon.fr:2402/cvs/public
        with the name gdcmData.
        All the python scripts (including the package initialisation file
        gdcmPython/__init__.py) were adapated to take this change into
        account (basically GDCM_DATA_PATH is now GDCM_TEST_DATA_PATH).

2003-05-5  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr> with JPR
      * vtk subdir added. Contains vtkGdcmReader.[cxx|h] a vtk class
        inherinting from vtkImageReader and testvtkGdcmReader.cxx a small
        demo of the usage of this class.
        Compilation of this vtk part is only done when using the --enable-vtk
        at configure (or autogen.sh) stage.

2003-04-16  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr> with JPR
      * More memory link related corrections and documentation fixes.
        Notes on valgrind:
          - maximum info is obtained with a command of the form:
            valgrind --leak-check=yes --leak-resolution=high --num-callers=40
                     --show-reachable=yes PrintHeader
          - the remaining reachable blocks seem to come from the STL
            allocation scheme through the usage of map and list. It looks
            like this memory cannot be freed but it is not a memory leak
            (in fact further invocation to the STL would recollect the
             unused memory allthough it cannot explicitely be freed).
      * gdcmPython/demo/vtkGdcmDemo.py added: this is a small demo
        of displaying an image parsed with gdcm and displayed with VTK.
        Note: some images don't seem to work e.g.
            python vtkGdcmDemo.py  ../../Data/US-RGB-8-esopecho.dcm
      * src/gdcmHeader.x: dicom_vr and Dicts are not class members anymore.
        Allthough this weakens the semantics, it is a ditch attempt to
        make gdcm more thread friendly.

2003-04-15  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr> with JPR
      * Memory link hunt (by using valgrind through the command
          valgrind --show-reachable=yes --leak-check=yes PrintHeader).
        - added src/gdcmVR.cxx gdcmVR.h that objectify the previous
          gdcmHeader::_dicom_vr.
        - gdcmHeader::InitVRDict transfered as gdcmVR::gdcmVR().
        - gdcmHeader::dicom_vr is now of type gdcmVR* as opposed to
          VRHT*.
        - gdcmGlobal global object contained class added (see src/gdcmUtil.x)

2003-04-9  Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr> with JPR
      * src/Makefile.am now exports all the necessary include files at
        make install stage.

2003-04-9 JPR
      * UpdateGroupLength replaced by new one

2003-04-7 JPR
      * UpdateGroupLength re-written using H-Table
        (named UpdateGroupLengthNew untill checks are over)

2003-04-7 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr> with JPR
      * Data/im_00001 renamed to gdcm-MR-PHILIPS-16-Multi-Seq.dcm
      * gdcmPython/testSuite.py now include a test of gdcmFile::Write.
      * src:
        - gdcmHeader::GetPubElValSet removed.
        - gdcmElValSet::WriteDcm, WriteAcr, WriteExplVR, revamped to
          UpdateGroupLength, WriteElements, Write.
        - gdcmHeader::FileType moved to gdcmCommon.h. The enum FileType
          doesn't contain TrueDicom anymore since ExplicitVR and ImplicitVR
          carried the same semantics.
          - src/gdcmHeaderIdo.cxx changed accordingly.
        - gdcmFile::WriteBase now regroups all the codes from previous
          versions of WriteDcm, WriteDcmImplVR, and WriteACR.
        - enum FileType moved to gdcmCommon.h
      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx AddDefault trashed
      * gdcmGetXSize added
      * getimageDataSize now calls gdcmGetXSize
      * Test/*.cxx changed to agree with above changes

2003-03-31 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmHeader.h: LoadElements() is not a public method anymore
        (to avoid double call by end user).
      * Test/*.cxx LoadElements() doesn't need to be called explicitely
        by end user, since gdcmHeader::gdcmHeader now handles it.

2003-03-29 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * gdcm/Doc many doxygen changes:
        - Doxyfile now has two different versions, DoxyfileUsers that generates
          the html.users end users oriented documentation and
          DoxyfileDeveloppers that generates the html.developper developper
          oriented documentation.
        - README changed accordingly
        - requirement.txt removed (old design info moved to TODO).
        - Additional files DoxyInstallation.txt, DoxyIntroduction.txt,
          DoxyMainPage.txt, DoxyPython.txt provide more information.
        - Note: the website http://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Public/Gdcm/ can now
          be updated by simply regenerating the docs with doxygen and copying
          html.developper and html.users to tux:/home/httpd/html/Public/Gdcm
      * src/gdcmElValSet.cxx: stl <map>.count() can only return 0 or 1. Hence
        all the tests in the form "if (<map>.count() >1)" were removed.
      * src/gdcmFile.cxx: cosmetic changes to avoid messages of doxygen about
        ill-formed documentation sections.
      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx: ditto

2003-03-27 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * setup.py fixed for un*x (needed macro for stdint.h)
      * Test/test.cxx renamed to PrintHeader.cxx to avoid collision on
        un*ces with sh-utils test utility.
      * gdcmPython/demo/test.py renamed to PrintHeader.py
      * gdcmPython/demo/ReorganiseFiles.py new demo script added.
      * gdcmPython/win32/gdcmpycomplet.dsp renamed to gdcmpyembedded.dsp.
      * gdcmPython/win32/gdcmpy.dsp trashed away (brain damaged).
      * src/gdcm*.cxx JPR's bad inclusion fixed.

2003-03-26 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmHeader[h, cxx] gdcmHeader now has an IsReadable predicate.
      * gdcmPython/demo/test.py changed accordingly.

2003-03-25 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * gdcmPython/Makefile.am fixed linking against libstdc++
      * gdcmPython/_gdcm.so symbolic link to gdcmPython/.libs/pygdcm.so added.
      * Swig subdir (historical tests of swig version 1.3.17++) removed
      * Test/testChangeEntete.cxx some lines commented out in order to make
        compilation work.
      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx cleaned up wild JPR's dirty kludge.
      * src/gdcmElValSet.cxx cleaned up frog's forgotten debug message

2003-03-24 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx gdcmHeader::gdcmHeader now calls LoadElements(),
        hence the user doesn't need this explicit call.
        - gdcmPython/testSuite.py, gdcmPython/demo/*.py changed accordingly
          i.e. LoadElements() call removed.
      * src/gdcmCommon.h now defines UINT32_MAX (see stdint.h).
        - src/Makefile.am declares the proper flag for g++.
      * src/gdcmElValSet.h added gdcmElValSet::GenerateFreeTagKeyInGroup
        for adding user defined new tags.
        - src/gdcmHeader.cxx gdcmHeader::NewManualElValToPubDict added.
        - src/gdcmHeader.cxx gdcmHeader::AddAndDefaultElements now
          cleanly adds some gdcm added tags (like gdcmXSize, gdcmYSize...)

2003-03-17 Fabrice Bellet <Fabrice.Bellet@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * Makefile.am, acinclude.m4, configure.in, python.m4, Dicts/Makefile.am,
        Doc/Makefile.am, Test/Makefile.am, gdcmPython/Makefile.am,
        src/Makefile.am : the project should properly compile and install
        with the autotools, included the python wrappers part.
      * gdcm.spec.in : added a spec file for RPM packaging.

2003-03-14 Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmUtils.cxx : redifinition of defaults parameters in code

2003-03-12 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * gdcmPython/__init__.py fix of GDCM_DICT_PATH which was not
        to exported to the environement (see gdcmPython/testSuite.py
        for usage).
      * src/gdcmElValSet.[cxx/h], gdcmElValue.[cxx/h], gdcmFile.[cxx/h],
        gdcmHeader.[cxx/h]: ElValSet class renamed to gdcmElValSet, and
        ElValue class renamed to gdcmElValue for obvious consistency reasons.
      * src/gdcmElValSet.cxx, src/gdcmUtil.[cxx-h] Tokenize utility function
        moved away from gdcmElValSet.cxx to gdcmUtil.cxx.

2003-03-10 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * gdcmPython/__init__.py doesn't crash anymore when running in
        in InstallMode or PreInstallMode but with an environement given
        value of GDCM_DICT_PATH.
      * src/gdcmDictSet.[cxx/h] coding style.

2003-03-06 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmHeader.h and gdcmHeader.cxx Coding style + doxigenation.
      * src/gdcm.h general comments moved to TODO, and README
      * src/gdcm.h should now be seen as a user commodity (including it
        should suffice to fully use gdcm). It is nowhere including within
        any of the kernel files src/*.cxx and src/*.h.

2003-03-05 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcm.h splitted in gdcmCommon.h, gdcmDict.h, gdcmDictEntry.h,
        gdcmDictSet.h, gdcmElValSet.h, gdcmElValue.h, gdcmFile.h,
        gdcmHeader.h
      * src/gdcm*.cxx only include their corresponding include file
        (as opposed to gdcm.h)
      * gdcmPython/gdcm.i changed accordingly
      * Test/Makefile.am corrected and added NEWS, AUTHORS in order for
        the autogen.sh generated "make snapshot" command to work.
      * autogen.sh removed history related references to crea package.

2003-03-04 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * distutilsSwigCPlusPlus.py work around some swig portability
        bug.

2003-03-03 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * Eventually, python/gdcmPython was renamed to gdcmPython. This
        was done in a last ditch attempt to get setup.py _really_
        operationnal. The python/gdcmPython layaout add the advantage
        of hidding away the python related distutils specific files
        (MANIFEST.in, setup.py, distutils*.py...) from the main directory.
        Alas, the src directory was out of scope (i.e. it's relative
        position to setup.py was ../src) which made things impossible to
        handle (see previous version of python/setup.py). Crossing fingers...

2003-02-20 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * python/setup.py now works on Un*x. (harder than I thougth)
      * python/distutilsSwigCPlusPlus.py can now have include files
        among the list of sources.

2003-02-20 Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx : bug fix - opening dicom file in binary !!!
      * modifications in MSVC projects

2003-02-19 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * As stated by the first lines of Test/ExceptionAndPython/README, it
        looks like we can move back to original usage of exception within
        src/gdcm* and hence remove the errno stuff that was introduced
        as a quick and dirty fixture of this problem (added to the TODO).
      * Doc/Doxyfile configuration file for Doxygen and corresponding
        README file for usage added.
      * Test/testWrite.cxx added. This new test comes from a split of
        test.cxx that is now reverted to its original purpous i.e.
        testing the proper parsing of a Dicom related file.
        testWrite.cxx concentrates on testing the IO part of gdcm.
      * Test/bug1.cxx (containing a bug on WIn32) added.
      * src/gdcm.h, gdcmHeader.cxx, gdcmDictSet.cxx:
        - gdcmHeader::GetPubTagNames and  gdcmHeader::GetPubTagNamesByCategory
          whose purpose is to publish the content of the TagNames of the
          Dicom public dictionnary were not accessible without an
          instance of class gdcmHeader.
        - those methods are now static methods of gdcmDictSet and hence
          require no instances at all to be invocated.
        - within gdcmDictSet this change required to change some method
          to class methods (i.e. are now static) among which SetDictPath
          (renamed to BuildDictPath) and LoadDefaultPubDict.
      * python/gdcmPython/demo/printGroupedPublicDict.py changed to illustrate
        the above changes by calling the new method classes of gdcmDictSet.
      * python/gdcmPython/__init__.py now exposes gdcm.gdcmDictSet for
        the above to be effective.
      * python/gdcmPython: in order to wrap properly the above changes
        for Python, swig version now needs to be > 1.3.17.
      * python/gdcmPython/Makefile fixed to adapt itself to new
        configure/make shema introduced by Johan Montagnat (thanks for the
        contribution). Alas this Makefile cannot be turned into a proper
        Makefile.am without some heavy changes in the configure.in
        (for python dectection).
      * python/gdcmPython/gdcm.i: the out typemap map<string, list<string>>*
        now avoids publishing the empty entries.

2003-02-13 Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * python/setup.py : bug fix concerning install under windows
        ExtraPath reused :-P
      * gdcm.dsw : bug fix concerning path for libraries for python !!!

2003-02-13 Benoit Regrain <Benoit.Regrain@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * Dicts/dicomV3.dic : remove double spaces !!!
      * src/gdcmElValSet.cxx : bug fix concerning windows compiler
      * python/gdcmPython/win32/gdcmpycomplet.dsp : bug fix concerning paths
        and links

2003-01-28 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx added a post header parsing AddAndDefaultElements
        method. Doxygenation.
      * src/gdcm.h clean up of JPR spurious comments.

2003-01-17 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * python/distutilsSwigCPlusPlus.py now properly collects the
        shadow classes generated by "swig -c++" (gdcm.py in our case)
        when using "python setup.py install".
      * python/gdcmPython/__init__.py imports gdcm.py and only manually
        reexports the working classes.
      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx all the try/catch/throw calls were replaced
        by the classical C errno scheme. This is to prevent an obscure
        behavior of the python wrappers when importing wxPython.wx prior
        to gdcmPython (which ended up in an abort call). An illustration
        of this oddity can be found in the Test/ExceptionAndPython
        subdir (see the README file). This problem probably due to
        an combination of g++ and dynamic loading.
      * added Test/ExceptionAndPython (see above)

2003-01-17 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * Changed the layout of the python part to avoid bloating main
        directory with setup.py, distutilsSwigCPlusPlus.py, MANIFEST.in
        i.e. the distutils arsenal. All the python related stuff is
        again in a python subdir, but the package itself is now in
        python/gdcmPython.
      * setup.py was cleaned up:
        - pythonIncludePath removed
        - python setup.py bdist target is now functional.
      * gdcmPython/__init__.py doesn't export FileName any more (to avoid
        collision with other packages). gdcmPython/demo/*.py changed
        accordingly.

2003-01-15 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * python subdir moved to gdcmPython (preparation of distutils packaging).
      * gdcmPython/setup.py and distutilsSwigCPlusPlus.py added. The
        distutils installer is operational.
      * - gdcmPython/__init__.py now properly loads the swig generated
          shadow classes (from gdcm.py).
        - gdcmPython/demo/*.py changed to import the package gdcmPython
          instead of gdcmPython/demo/load.py.
        - gdcmPython/testSuite.py changed to import the package gdcmPython.

2002-12-16 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcm.h, src/gdcmHeader.cxx: added GetPubTagNames() resp.
        GetPubTagNamesByCategory() to gdcmHeader that return a list of the
        entries within the associated public Dicom dictionary resp. the same
        information but sorted by the fourth field (PAT, IMG, DIR) of the
        dictionary.
        - Dicts/dicomV3.dic Entries which had and unspecified fourth field
          are now in the "???" group.
        - python/gdcm.i changed accordingly,
        - python/demo/printGroupedPublicDict.py added, that gives an example
          of the above new functionalities in Python.

2002-12-11 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcm.h, gdcmHeader.cxx:
        - historic references to glib's g_malloc and g_free (#defined)
          were definitively removed.
        - gdcm.h: cosmetic changes (part of comments moved to Doc/requirements)
      * src/gdcmElValSet.cxx:
        - GetElement(guint32, guint32) renamed to GetElementByNumber.
        - GetElValue(guint32, guint32) renamed to GetElValueByNumber.
        - GetElValue(string) renamed to GetElValueByName.
        - Added GetElementByName(string).
      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx: added
        - GetPubElValRepByNumber(guint16, guint16)
        - GetPubElValRepByName(string)
        - GetShaElValRepByNumber(guint16, guint16)
        - GetShaElValRepByName(string)
        - GetShaElValByNumber(guint16, guint16)
        - GetShaElValRepByName(string)
        - GetElValRepByNumber(guint16, guint16)
        - GetElValRepByName(string)
        - GetElValByNumber(guint16, guint16)
        - GetElValRepByName(string)
      * Doc/requirements.txt added.

2002-12-9 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * Test/Makefile building now depends on the one of libgdcm.so
      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx and gdcm.h are now OB (undefined length encoded
        pixel data) aware which enables finding the address (offset) of
        the pixel data of JPEG encoded DICOM files. This leaves only a single
        file in the testSuite whose pixel data address (offset) is unknown.
      * python/testSuite.py changed accordingly.

2002-12-6 Christophe Odet + Hugues Benoit-Cattin + Eric.Boix
      * VC++ has some strong limitations when working with the STL, as stated
        in http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q168/9/58.ASP :
             "Also note that some STL containers (map, set, queue, list, deque)
              cannot be exported. [...]
              Some STL classes contain nested classes. These classes can not
              be exported. [...]
              This is caused by a designed limitation that once a template
              class is instantiated, it can not be re-instantiated and
              exported."
        Since our usage of map<> is ubiquitous in gdcm, this "designed
        limitation" of VC++ is a pitfall.
        Hence the Python wrappers of gdcm cannot be incrementally linked
        against the c++ dynamic library. The dirty but only workaround is
        to forget about incremental link of dynamic libraries and to generate
        the Python wrappers library with the inclusions of the underlying C++
        library.
        The following modifications concern this matter on Win32/VC++:
      - wrapping python correct with standalone wrapped dll (don't use separate
         dll under windows !!!!)
      - python21_d debug mode enabled (ask Frog how to use it :-)
      - NO problem with having an STL member of class for example string in C++
        WITH THE RESTRICTION OF FORGETING ABOUT INCREMENTAL LINK.
      - Python test of dcmlib in Python is ok under windows on a large set
        (one) of image(s).
      * removed glib references
      * typedef's inserted in gdcm.i for correct swig type management

2002-11-27 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * python/demo/*.py load.py extracted from test.py. Added explore.py
        that only displays required tags and testAll.py that parses all
        the files of the testsuite without using unittest.
      * python/testSuite.py other additional test on new files added.
      * Data/* new test files added accordingly to the testSuite.
      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx avoid overwriting of the dictionary when
        the vr in the file differs from the one of the dictionary.

2002-11-20 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcm.h and gdcmHeader.cxx gdcm no longer loads all the elements
        values, but limits itself to values which are below a user specified
        size (by default 1024 bytes).
      * python/gdcm.i : elements not loaded (because their size is above the
        user specified treshold) are exported with their TagKey as key of the
        python dictionary. This enables the testsuite to make some checks
        on the unloaded elements (since we have their offset and size).
      * python/testSuite.py
        - now tests for the existence and proper value of the pixel data
        - two new examples added.
      * Data/gdcm-MR-SIEMENS-16.acr[12] added.

2002-11-18 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcm.h and gdcmHeader.cxx are now "Big Endian transfer syntax"
        aware. See the strategy comments in gdcmHeader::FindeLength().
      * Test/test.cxx now accepts a filename as first argument.
      * Data/US-PAL-8-10x-echo.dcm and US-RGB-8-epicard.dcm added.
      * python/testSuite.py changed to integrate test on above files.

2002-11-15 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * Dicts/dicomV3.dic removed all the trailing (RET) when the
        the vr was also RET.
      * python/testSuite.py more tests added.

2002-11-14 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * python/testSuite.py unittest test suite added (uses Data)
      * Data/* dcm and acr files for the test suite.
      * glib dependance removed from un*x version. We now use ISO C99
        7.18 Integer types (see stdint.h)
        - python/Makefile, src/Makefile src/gdcm.h
      * src/ when an explicit vr (like dicom files) suddenly poped an
        implicit element we use to mark the underlying DictEntry of the
        concerned ElValue with "Implicit". This strategy was damageable
        too the public or provite dictionaries, since some of their vr
        would be changed. Since Header::FindLength heavily relies on the
        detection by Header::FindVR of falsely explicit elements, I
        added an extra ImplicitVr member to ElValue (boolean).
        The rest of the changes we the necessary adaptations.

2002-11-12 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmHeader::FindLength bug fix when trapping falsely explicit
        VR files.
      * src/gdcmHeader::FindVR: hard way fix of falsely explicit vr files.

2002-11-8 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * Adaptation for porting to VC++:
        - src/gdcm.h
          o forced to use std namespace (for string to be known)
          o all class use __declspec export style on WIN32
        - src/gdcmUtil.cxx new Exit method that wraps the exit call
          (in stdlib.h on Win32 but in std:: for gcc)
      * src/gdcmDictSet::SetDictPath adds a trailing / to environement
        variable GDCM_DICT_PATH.
      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx verbose comments made discrete.

2002-11-7 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * python/gdcm.i: added a typemap that converts a C++ hashing table
        to native Python dictionary.
      * python/demo/test.py:
        - now uses the native dictionary for exploration of gdcmHeader.
        - takes an optional filename argument (the file to parse).
      * src/gdcm.h and gdcmHeader.cxx: gdcmHeader now has an accessor on
        PubElVals hashing table.
      * Dicts/dicomV3.dic removed error prone trailing spaces.

2002-11-6 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * Python wrapping process moved away from src/Makefile to
        newly created python/Makefile (as well as gdcm.i)
      * python/demo/test.py (that mirrors Test/test.cxx) is effective.
      * src/gdcmHeader::FindLength only looks for current vr when necessary.
      * src/gdcmDictSet.cxx: the dictionnaries directory path is now imported
        from the environement variable GDCM_DICT_PATH (when existing).
      * src/gdcmDict::GetTag bug fix.

2002-10-31 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * Straightforward temporary fixes for swig to build the python wrappers.
        src/Makefile now has a python working entry [by working we mean
        that we can import de shadow classes without errors].

2002-10-29 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * hashtest.cxx removed (since allready in Test)
      * src/gdcmlib.h renamed to src/gdcm.h
      * src/dcm.i renamed to src/gdcm.i
      * src/Makefile prepared for python wrapping

2002-10-29 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx :
        - Parsing of header is now separated from loading of element values
          (see gdcmHeader::LoadElements).
        - general clean up of hopefully all file access (creation of
          ReadInt16 and ReadInt32)

2002-10-22 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx :
        - RecupLgr renamed to FindLength and cut off with new IsAnInteger
          method.
        - SetLgrElem renamed to SetLength
        - GetLgrElem renamed to GetLength
        - ~gdcmHeader() made virtual to pesky warning messages at compile.
      * src/gdcmElValSet.cxx fixed both GetElValue methods
      * Dicts/dicomV3.dic falacious entry [7fe0 0010 OT PXL Pixel Data]
        due to IdoDude was cleaned out.

      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx RecupLgr split in FindVR and RecupLgr. FindVR
        concentrates on finding the value representation (when it exists).
        RecupLgr now only finds the element value length, and it avoids
        returning the unecessary skL (skipped length).
        Also, offsetCourant was simply removed (with taille_fich) since
        it was redundant with the File position internals (by using
        ftell and fseek). This also made skL (see above in RecupLgr) usage
        jajun.
      * src/gdcmHeaderIdo.cxx src/gdcmIdo.h added. Those files concentrate
        on the libido specificities which are handled through class
        inheritance.
      * Test/implicit_vr.dcm dicom v3 in implicit value representation
        added.

      * Truckload of changes. Parsing of header is barely functional
        (see Test/test) with the standard dictionary (see Dicts/dicomV3.dic).

2002-10-10 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx many addons of low level methods

2002-10-07 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmHeader now contains_IdDcmCheckSwap, _IdDcmRecupLgr,
        and _IdDcmSWAP_LONG.

2002-09-12 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * This corresponds to all the changes decided at the meeting of
        May 23 2002. Needless to say we are running late...

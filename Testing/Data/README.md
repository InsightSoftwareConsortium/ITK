ITK Testing Data
================

The ITK `Testing/Data` folder hosts the files that are used by ITK's automatic
tests and hence ensure the health of the toolkit:

  * The `Baseline` directory contains valid images created by tests. Generated
  images are compared with these baseline images during regression testing.
  * The `Input` directory contains data files that are used by the tests.

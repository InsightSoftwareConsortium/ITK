set(DOCUMENTATION "This module contains filters that perform pixel-wise
operations on the intensities of images. In particular you will find here
filters that compute trigonometric operations on pixel values, intensity
rescaling, exponentials, conversions between complex and reals, and filters
that combine multiple images into images of multiple components, as well as
filters that compute single scalar images from images of multiple components.")

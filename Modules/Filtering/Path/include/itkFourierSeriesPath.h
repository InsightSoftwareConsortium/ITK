/** \class FourierSeriesPath
 * \brief  Represent a closed path through ND Space by its frequency components
 *
 * This class is intended to represent closed parametric paths through an image
 * which are defined by their Fourier coeficients (frequency components).  The
 * paths must be closed and defined over the interval [0,1], where the paths'
 * values at input 0 and input 1 are identical.  The user can control how many
 * harmonics (how high of frequency components) are represented by a given
 * instantiation of this class.  Classic applications of this class include
 * smoothing other closed paths (by finding and using only the first n harmonics
 * of their frequency components) and interpolating exact derivatives of other
 * closed paths by first converting the other paths to FourierSeriesPaths, which
 * have an exactly defined algebraic derivative.  (As many harmonics as are
 * necessary to adequately approximate the original path should be used when
 * approximating derivatives.)

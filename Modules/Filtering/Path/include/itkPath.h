 *\class Path
 * \brief  Represent a path through ND Space
 *
 * This base class is intended to represent a path through an image.   As a
 * path, it maps a 1D parameter (such as time or arc length, etc) to an index
 * (or possibly an offset or a point) in ND space.  This mapping is done via the
 * abstract Evaluate() method, which must be overridden in all instantiable
 * subclasses. The only geometric requirement for a gerneral path is that it be
 * continuous. A path may be open or closed, and may cross itself several
 * times.  A classic application of this class is the representation of contours
 * in 2D images using chaincodes or freeman codes.  Another use of a path is to
 * guide the movement of an iterator through an image.
 *
 * \tparam TInput Type of the 1D parameter of the path, e.g. unsigned int or double.
 * \tparam TOutput Type of the path location at the given input, e.g.
 * itk::Offset< VDimension > or itk::ContinuousIndex< VDimension >
 * \tparam VDimension Dimension of the path.
 *
 * \sa Index
 * \sa Point
 * \sa ContinuousIndex

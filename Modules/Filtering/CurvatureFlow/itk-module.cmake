set(DOCUMENTATION "This module contains filters that implement variations of
Curvature Flow. This is a technique that uses an iterative solution of partial
differential equations to implement image denoising image filtering. These
classes are typically used as edge-preserving smoothing filters. You may also
find the ITKSmoothing and the ITKAnisotropicSmoothing useful as well.")

/** \class ReflectiveImageRegionConstIterator
 * \brief Multi-dimensional image iterator which only walks a region.
 *
 * ReflectiveImageRegionConstIterator is a templated class to represent a
 * multi-dimensional iterator. ReflectiveImageRegionConstIterator is templated
 * over the image type. ReflectiveImageRegionConstIterator is constrained to
 * walk only within the specified region.
 *
 * ReflectiveImageRegionConstIterator will perform two passes over the image
 * along each dimension. It is useful for algorithms that require to
 * go back and forth (once) over the data.
 *
 * By setting the BeginOffset and EndOffset parameters, you can arrange for
 * the starting point, when going forwards, to be different from the ending
 * point, when going backwards. Along dimension d, when going forwards the
 * iterator traverses the interval [BeginIndex[d]+BeginOffset[d], EndIndex[d]).
 * When going back, it traverses the interval (EndIndex[d]-EndOffset[d],
 * BeginIndex[d]].  Setting both offsets to (1, ..., 1) enables the
 * DanielssonDistanceMapImageFilter to process the entire image,
 * without encountering boundary conditions, rather
 * than removing a one-pixel border.

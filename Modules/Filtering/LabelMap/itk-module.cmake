  DOCUMENTATION
  "This module contains the infrastructure to store the label images
in an efficient and convenient way, including label images with overlapping objects.
All the objects contained in the LabelMap can be associated to values
called attributes. Some filters are available to compute the usual attributes values
related to the shape of the objects or the pixels values in the objects and to manipulate
the objects based on these values."

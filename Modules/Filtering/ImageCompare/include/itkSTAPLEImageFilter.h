 *\class STAPLEImageFilter
 *
 * \brief The STAPLE filter implements the Simultaneous Truth and Performance
 * Level Estimation algorithm for generating ground truth volumes from a set of
 * binary expert segmentations.
 *
 * The STAPLE algorithm treats segmentation as a pixelwise classification,
 * which leads to an averaging scheme that accounts for systematic biases in
 * the behavior of experts in order to generate a fuzzy ground truth volume and
 * simultaneous accuracy assessment of each expert. The ground truth volumes
 * produced by this filter are floating point volumes of values between zero
 * and one that indicate probability of each pixel being in the object targeted
 * by the segmentation.
 *
 * The STAPLE algorithm is described in
 *
 * S. Warfield, K. Zou, W. Wells, "Validation of image segmentation and expert
 * quality with an expectation-maximization algorithm" in MICCAI 2002: Fifth
 * International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted
 * Intervention, Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany, 2002, pp. 298-306
 *
 * \par INPUTS
 * Input volumes to the STAPLE filter must be binary segmentations of an image,
 * that is, there must be a single foreground value that represents positively
 * classified pixels (pixels that are considered to belong inside the
 * segmentation).  Any number of background pixel values may be present in the
 * input images.  You can, for example, input volumes with many different
 * labels as long as the structure you are interested in creating ground truth
 * for is consistently labeled among all input volumes.  Pixel type of the
 * input volumes does not matter.  Specify the label value for positively
 * classified pixels using SetForegroundValue.  All other labels will be
 * considered to be negatively classified pixels (background).
 *
 * Input volumes must all contain the same size RequestedRegions.
 *
 * \par OUTPUTS
 * The STAPLE filter produces a single output volume with a range of floating
 * point values from zero to one. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO INSTANTIATE THIS
 * FILTER WITH A FLOATING POINT OUTPUT TYPE (floats or doubles).  You may
 * threshold the output above some probability threshold if you wish to produce
 * a binary ground truth.
 *
 * \par PARAMETERS
 * The STAPLE algorithm requires a number of inputs.  You may specify any
 * number of input volumes using the SetInput(i, p_i) method, where i ranges
 * from zero to N-1, N is the total number of input segmentations, and p_i is
 * the SmartPointer to the i-th segmentation.
 *
 * The SetConfidenceWeight parameter is a modifier for the prior probability
 * that any pixel would be classified as inside the target object.  This
 * implementation of the STAPLE algorithm automatically calculates prior
 * positive classification probability as the average fraction of the image
 * volume filled by the target object in each input segmentation.  The
 * ConfidenceWeight parameter allows for scaling the of this default prior
 * probability: if g_t is the prior probability that a pixel would be
 * classified inside the target object, then g_t is set to g_t *
 * ConfidenceWeight before iterating on the solution.  In general
 * ConfidenceWeight should be left to the default of 1.0.
 *
 * You must provide a foreground value using SetForegroundValue that the STAPLE
 * algorithm will use to identify positively classified pixels in the the input
 * images.  All other values in the image will be treated as background values.
 * For example, if your input segmentations consist of 1's everywhere inside
 * the segmented region, then use SetForegroundValue(1).
 *
 * The STAPLE algorithm is an iterative E-M algorithm and will converge on a
 * solution after some number of iterations that cannot be known a priori.
 * After updating the filter, the total elapsed iterations taken to converge on
 * the solution can be queried through GetElapsedIterations().  You may also
 * specify a MaximumNumberOfIterations, after which the algorithm will stop
 * iterating regardless of whether or not it has converged.  This
 * implementation of the STAPLE algorithm will find the solution to within
 * seven digits of precision unless it is stopped early.
 *
 * Once updated, the Sensitivity (true positive fraction, q) and Specificity
 * (true negative fraction, q) for each expert input volume can be queried
 * using GetSensitivity(i) and GetSpecificity(i), where i is the i-th input
 * volume.
 *
 * \par REQUIRED PARAMETERS
 * The only required parameters for this filter are the ForegroundValue and the
 * input volumes.  All other parameters may be safely left to their default
 * values. Please see the paper cited above for more information on the STAPLE
 * algorithm and its parameters.  A proper understanding of the algorithm is
 * important for interpreting the results that it produces.
 *
 * \par EVENTS
 * This filter invokes IterationEvent() at each iteration of the E-M
 * algorithm. Setting the AbortGenerateData() flag will cause the algorithm to
 * halt after the current iteration and produce results just as if it had
 * converged. The algorithm makes no attempt to report its progress since the
 * number of iterations needed cannot be known in advance.

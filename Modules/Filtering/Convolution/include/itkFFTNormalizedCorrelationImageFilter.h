/**
 * \class FFTNormalizedCorrelationImageFilter
 * \brief Calculate normalized cross correlation using FFTs.
 *
 * This filter calculates the normalized cross correlation (NCC) of two
 * images using FFTs instead of spatial correlation.
 * It is much faster than spatial correlation
 * for reasonably large structuring elements.
 * This filter is a subclass of the more general
 * MaskedFFTNormalizedCorrelationImageFilter and operates by
 * essentially setting the masks in that algorithm to images of ones.
 * As described in detail in the references below, there is no computational
 * overhead to utilizing the more general masked algorithm because the FFTs
 * of the images of ones are still necessary for the computations.
 *
 * Inputs:
 * Two images are required as inputs, fixedImage and movingImage.
 * In the context of correlation, inputs are often defined as: "image"
 * and "template".  In this filter, the fixedImage plays the role of the
 * image, and the movingImage plays the role of the template.
 * However, this filter is capable of correlating any two images and
 * is not restricted to small movingImages (templates).
 *
 * Optional parameters:
 * The RequiredNumberOfOverlappingPixels enables the user to specify how many voxels
 * of the two images must overlap; any location in the correlation map that results
 * from fewer than this number of voxels will be set to zero.
 * Larger values zero-out pixels on a larger border around the correlation image.
 * Thus, larger values remove less stable computations but also limit the capture range.
 * If RequiredNumberOfOverlappingPixels is set to 0, the default, no zeroing will take place.
 *
 * Image size:
 * fixedImage and movingImage need not be the same size.
 * Furthermore, whereas some algorithms require that the "template"
 * be smaller than the "image" because of errors in the regions where
 * the two are not fully overlapping, this filter has no such restriction.
 *
 * Image spacing:
 * Since the computations are done in the pixel domain, all input
 * images must have the same spacing.
 *
 * Outputs;
 * The output is an image of RealPixelType that is the NCC of
 * the two images and its values range from -1.0 to 1.0.
 * The size of this NCC image is, by definition,
 * size(fixedImage) + size(movingImage) - 1.
 *
 * Example filter usage:
 * \code
 * typedef itk::FFTNormalizedCorrelationImageFilter< ShortImageType, DoubleImageType > FilterType;
 * FilterType::Pointer filter = FilterType::New();
 * filter->SetFixedImage( fixedImage );
 * filter->SetMovingImage( movingImage );
 * filter->SetRequiredNumberOfOverlappingPixels(20);
 * filter->Update();
 * \endcode
 *
 * \warning The pixel type of the output image must be of real type
 * (float or double). ConceptChecking is used to enforce the output pixel
 * type. You will get a compilation error if the pixel type of the
 * output image is not float or double.

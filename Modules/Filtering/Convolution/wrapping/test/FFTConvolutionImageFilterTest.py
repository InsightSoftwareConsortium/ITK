#  Verify FFT-based convolution in Python.
#
#  This checks that necessary FFT factories have been registered by default
#  and synchronized across modules so that they are available to filters in
#  the FFTConvolution Python module.
#
#  See `itkObjectFactoryBase.h` and `itkSingletonIndex.h` for more information.

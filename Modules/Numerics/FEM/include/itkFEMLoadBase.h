 * All other load classes that can be used in a FEM system are defined by deriving this one.
 * The load class defines an external load that acts on the system. For each specific subtype
 * of load, a separate load abstract class should be derived. For example we have LoadElement,
 * which defines the base for all loads that act on a specific element in a system.

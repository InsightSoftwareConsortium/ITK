/** \class ParticleSwarmOptimizer
 * \brief Implementation of a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm.
 *
 * The PSO algorithm was originally presented in:<br>
 * J. Kennedy, R. Eberhart, "Particle Swarm Optimization",
 * Proc. IEEE Int. Neural Networks, 1995.<br>
 *
 * The algorithm uses a stochastic optimization approach. Optimization
 * is performed by maintaining a swarm (flock) of
 * particles that traverse the parameter space, searching for the optimal
 * function value. Associated with each particle are its location and speed, in
 * parameter space. A particle's next location is determined by its current
 * location, its current speed, the location of the best function value it
 * previously encountered, and the location of the best function value the
 * particles in its neighborhood previously encountered. In this implementation
 * we use a global neighborhood with the following update equations:<br>
 * \f[v_i(t+1) = wv_i(t) + c_1u_1(p_i-x_i(t)) + c_2u_2(p_g-x_i(t))\f]
 * \f[x_i(t+1) = clampToBounds(x_i(t) + v_i(t+1))\f]
 *
 * where \f$u_i\f$ are \f$~U(0,1)\f$ and \f$w,c_1,c_2\f$ are user selected
 * weights.
 *
 * Swarm initialization is performed within the user supplied parameter bounds
 * using a uniform distribution or a normal distribution centered on
 * the initial parameter values supplied by the user. The search terminates when
 * the maximal number of iterations has been reached or when the change in the
 * best value in the past \f$g\f$ generations is below a threshold and the swarm
 * has collapsed (i.e. particles are close to each other in parameter space).
 *
 * NOTE: This implementation only performs minimization.

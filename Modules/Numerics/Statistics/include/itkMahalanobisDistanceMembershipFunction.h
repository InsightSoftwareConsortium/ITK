/** \class MahalanobisDistanceMembershipFunction
 * \brief MahalanobisDistanceMembershipFunction models class
 * membership using Mahalanobis distance.
 *
 * MahalanobisDistanceMembershipFunction is a subclass of
 * MembershipFunctionBase that models class membership (or likelihood)
 * using the Mahalanobis distance. The mean and covariance structure
 * of the Mahalanobis distance are established using the methods
 * SetMean() and SetCovariance(). The mean is a vector-type that is the same
 * vector-type as the measurement vector but guaranteed to have a real
 * element type. For instance, if the measurement type is an
 * Vector<int,3>, then the mean is Vector<double,3>. If the
 * measurement type is a VariableLengthVector<float>, then the mean is
 * VariableLengthVector<double>. In contrast to this behavior, the
 * covariance is always a VariableSizeMatrix<double>.
 *
 * Note that this membership function does not return a probability
 * density function in contrast to the GaussianMembershipFunction.
 *
 * Note, as is the case in other packages (MATLAB, R), the value
 * returned by this membership function is the squared distance.
 *
 * If the covariance is singular or nearly singular, the membership function
 * behaves somewhat like (the opposite of) an impulse located at the
 * mean. In this case, we specify the covariance to be a diagonal
 * matrix with large values along the diagonal. This membership
 * function, therefore, will return large but differentiable values
 * everywhere and decay to zero sharply near the mean.

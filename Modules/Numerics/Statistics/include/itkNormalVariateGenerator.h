/** \class NormalVariateGenerator
 * \brief Normal random variate generator
 *
 * This generation method was initially developed and implemented by
 * Martin Styner, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
 * and his colleagues.
 *
 * You should run Initialize() function before call GetNormalVariate()
 * function.
 *
 * The followings are original comments.
 *
 *  Revision date 31 May 1996
 *      This is a revised version of the algorithm described in
 *
 *      ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol 22, No 1
 *      March 1996, pp 119-127.
 *
 * It is somewhat faster, and uses less memory as the vector of variates is
 * updated in-situ. It has passed all the same statistical tests as described
 * in the TOMS article, plus others. Seems OK so far.
 *
 *        Works well with total pool of 1024 variates, and does not need
 *        two vectors of this size, so does less damage to cache.
 *                Has been tested for frequency of tail values which
 *        should occur once in a million. OK. Other usual tests OK.
 *        About 13 % faster than TOMS version.
 *
 *        FAST GENERATOR OF PSEUDO-RANDOM UNIT NORMAL VARIATES
 *
 *                C.S.Wallace, Monash University, 1994
 *
 * To use this code, files needing to call the generator should include:
   \code
   #include "FastNorm.h"
   \endcode
 * and be linked with the maths library (-lm)
 *        FastNorm.h contains declaration of the initialization routine
 * 'initnorm()', definition of a macro 'FastGauss' used to generate variates,
 * and three variables used in the macro.
 *        Read below for calling conventions.
 *
 * THIS CODE ASSUMES TWO'S-COMPLEMENT 32-BIT INTEGER ARITHMATIC.  IT ALSO
 * ASSUMES THE 'C' COMPILER COMPILES THE LEFT-SHIFT OPERATOR "<<" AS A LOGICAL
 * SHIFT, DISCARDING THE SIGN DIGIT AND SHIFTING IN ZEROS ON THE RIGHT, SO
 * " X << 1" IS EQUIVALENT TO " X+X ".   IT ALSO ASSUMES THE RIGHT-SHIFT
 * OPERATOR ">>" IS SIGN-PRESERVING, SO ( -2 >> 1) = -1,  ( -1>>1) = -1.
 *
 *
 *
 *         A fast generator of pseudo-random variates from the unit Normal
 * distribution. It keeps a pool of about 1000 variates, and generates new
 * ones by picking 4 from the pool, rotating the 4-vector with these as its
 * components, and replacing the old variates with the components of the
 * rotated vector.
 *
 *
 *         The program should initialize the generator by calling
 * initnorm(seed)
 * with seed a int integer seed value. Different seed values will give
 * different sequences of Normals.
 *         Then, wherever the program needs a new Normal variate, it should
 * use the macro FastGauss, e.g. in statements like:
 *         x = FastGauss;  (Sets x to a random Normal value)

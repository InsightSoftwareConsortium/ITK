/** \class ScalarImageToTextureFeaturesFilter
 *  \brief This class computes texture descriptions from an image.
 *
 * This class computes features that summarize the texture of a given image.
 * The texture features are computed a la Haralick, and have proven to be useful
 * in image classification for biological and medical imaging.
 * This class computes the texture features of an image (optionally in a
 * masked region), averaged across several spatial directions so that they are
 * invariant to rotation.
 *
 * By default, texure features are computed for each spatial
 * direction and then averaged afterward, so it is possible to access the standard
 * deviations of the texture features. These values give a clue as to texture
 * anisotropy. However, doing this is much more work, because it involved computing
 * one GLCM for each offset given. To compute a single GLCM using the first offset ,
 * call FastCalculationsOn(). If this is called, then the texture standard deviations
 * will not be computed (and will be set to zero), but texture computation will
 * be much faster.
 *
 * This class is templated over the input image type.
 *
 * Template Parameters:
 * The image type, and the type of histogram frequency container. If you are using
 * a large number of bins per axis, a sparse frequency container may be advisable.
 * The default is to use a dense frequency container.
 *
 * Inputs and parameters:
 * -# An image
 * -# A mask defining the region over which texture features will be
 *    calculated. (Optional)
 * -# The pixel value that defines the "inside" of the mask. (Optional, defaults
 *    to 1 if a mask is set.)
 * -# The set of features to be calculated. These features are defined
 *    in the GreyLevelCooccurrenceMatrixTextureCoefficientsCalculator class. (Optional,
 *    defaults to {Energy, Entropy, InverseDifferenceMoment, Inertia, ClusterShade,
 *    ClusterProminence}, as in Conners, Trivedi and Harlow.)
 * -# The number of intensity bins. (Optional, defaults to 256.)
 * -# The set of directions (offsets) to average across. (Optional, defaults to
 *    {(-1, 0), (-1, -1), (0, -1), (1, -1)} for 2D images and scales analogously for ND
 *    images.)
 * -# The pixel intensity range over which the features will be calculated.
 *    (Optional, defaults to the full dynamic range of the pixel type.)
 *
 * In general, the default parameter values should be sufficient.
 *
 * Outputs:
 * (1) The average value of each feature.
 * (2) The standard deviation in the values of each feature.

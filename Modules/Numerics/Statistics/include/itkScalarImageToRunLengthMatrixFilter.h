 *\class ScalarImageToRunLengthMatrixFilter
 *  \brief This class computes a run length matrix (histogram) from
 *  a given image and a mask image if provided. Run length matrices are
 *  used for image texture description.
 *
 * This filters creates a grey-level run length matrix from a N-D scalar
 * image. This is another possible texture description.  See the following
 * references.
 * M. M. Galloway. Texture analysis using gray level run lengths. Computer
 * Graphics and Image Processing, 4:172-179, 1975.
 *
 * A. Chu, C. M. Sehgal, and J. F. Greenleaf. Use of gray value distribution of
 * run lengths for texture analysis.  Pattern Recognition Letters, 11:415-420,
 * 1990.
 *
 * B. R. Dasarathy and E. B. Holder. Image characterizations based on joint
 * gray-level run-length distributions. Pattern Recognition Letters, 12:490-502,
 * 1991.
 *
 * The basic idea is as follows:
 * Given an image and an offset (e.g. (1, -1) for a 2-d image), each element
 * in the joint histogram describes the frequency for a particular distance/
 * intensity pair within a given image.  This distance/intensity pair can be
 * described as follows: we start at a given voxel which has some intensity.
 * We then "jump" to neighboring pixels in increments provided by the offset(s)
 * as long as the pixel to which we are jumping is within the same intensity
 * bin as the original voxel.  The distance component is given by the distance
 * from the original to the final voxel satisfying our jumping criteria.
 *
 * The offset (or offsets) along which the co-occurences are calculated can be
 * set by the user. Traditionally, only one offset is used per histogram, and
 * offset components in the range [-1, 1] are used. For rotation-invariant
 * features averages of features computed over several histograms with different
 * offsets are generally used, instead of computing features from one histogram
 * create with several offsets. Additionally, instead of using offsets of two or
 * more pixels in any direction, multi-resolution techniques (e.g. image
 * pyramids) are generally used to deal with texture at different spatial
 * resolutions.
 *
 * This class calculates a 2-d histogram of all the intensity/distance pairs in
 * the given image's requested region, for a given set of offsets. That is, if
 * a given offset falls outside of the requested region (or outside the mask)
 * at a particular point, that distance/intensity pair will not be added to
 * the matrix.
 *
 * The number of histogram bins on each axis can be set (defaults to 256). Also,
 * by default the histogram min and max corresponds to the largest and smallest
 * possible pixel value of that pixel type. To customize the histogram bounds
 * for a given image, the max and min pixel values that will be placed in the
 * histogram can be set manually. NB: The min and max are INCLUSIVE.
 *
 * Further, the type of histogram frequency container used is an optional
 * template parameter. By default, a dense container is used, but for images
 * with little texture or in cases where the user wants more histogram bins,
 * a sparse container can be used for the histogram instead.
 *
 * WARNING: This probably won't work for pixels of double or long-double type
 * unless you set the histogram min and max manually. This is because the largest
 * histogram bin by default has max value of the largest possible pixel value
 * plus 1. For double and long-double types, whose "RealType" as defined by the
 * NumericTraits class is the same, and thus cannot hold any larger values,
 * this would cause a float overflow.

 *
 * \brief A base class for specific ImageIO file formats which support
 * streaming
 *
 * This class overloads the methods needed to enable streaming. These
 * methods are utilized by the ImageFileReader and
 * ImageFileWriter. The implementation supports streaming of an
 * arbitrary sized region as well as pasting to new or existing file (
 * of the same name, size, and pixel type ).
 * \sa CanStreamWrite CanStreamRead
 * GenerateStreamableReadRegionFromRequestedRegion GetActualNumberOfSplitsForWriting
 *
 * Additionally low level IO methods are provided to read and write an IORegion from
 * a file.
 * \sa StreamReadBufferAsBinary StreamWriteBufferAsBinary
 *
 * This implementation was taken fron the Insight Joural:
 * https://www.insight-journal.org/browse/publication/729

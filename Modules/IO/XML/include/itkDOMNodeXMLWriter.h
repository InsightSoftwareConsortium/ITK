/**
 * \class DOMNodeXMLWriter
 * \brief Class to write a DOM object to an XML file or an output stream.
 *
 * This class takes a user DOM object and write it to a destination such as file, string, console, etc.
 * Before using this class, the DOM object should have been generated from a user object.
 *
 * We do not recommend to directly use this class for user object writing, because the user has to handle
 * both DOM object generation from the user object and XML output from the intermediate DOM object.
 * Users should derive from the DOMWriter, because it performs the latter step automatically and lets the users
 * concentrate on the former step, thus implementation of such a writer is simplified.
 *
 * Note: Though this class behaves similar to ProcessObject, it is not derived from ProcessObject. This is
 *       because the input of this class, i.e. a DOMNode object, is not a DataObject, thus this class cannot
 *       be connected to an ITK process pipeline.
 *
 * The following code snippet demonstrates how to write a DOM object to an XML file:
 *
 *     itk::DOMNode::Pointer input_dom_object = ...
 *     const char* output_xml_file_name = ...
 *     itk::DOMNodeXMLWriter::Pointer writer = itk::DOMNodeXMLWriter::New();
 *     writer->SetInput( input_dom_object );
 *     writer->SetFileName( output_xml_file_name );
 *     writer->Update();
 *
 * \sa DOMWriter
 * \sa DOMNode

 * \ingroup ITKIOXML

 *\class GDCMSeriesFileNames
 * \brief Generate a sequence of filenames from a DICOM series.
 *
 * This class generates a sequence of files whose filenames point to
 * a DICOM file. The ordering is based on the following strategy:
 * Read all images in the directory (assuming there is only one study/series)
 *
 *   1. Extract Image Orientation & Image Position from DICOM images, and then
 *      calculate the ordering based on the 3D coordinate of the slice.
 *   2. If for some reason this information is not found or failed, another
 *      strategy is used: the ordering is based on 'Instance Number'.
 *   3. If this strategy also failed, then the filenames are ordered by
 *      lexicographical order.
 *
 *  If multiple volumes are being grouped as a single series for your
 *    DICOM objects, you may want to try calling SetUseSeriesDetails(true)
 *    prior to calling SetDirectory().

/**
 * \class PolygonGroupSpatialObject
 * \brief Implements a Region Of Interest Type
 *
 * This class implements a Region of Interest, which is simply a space
 * in a medical image that has some significance as a component of the
 * scan.  Different components of brain anatomy, for instance are Regions
 * of Interest in the human brain.
 * The primary difference between PolygonGroupSpatialObject and other
 * descendants of SpatialObject are these:
 * 1. For now, an PolygonGroup needs to comprise a series of slices parallel to
 * a plane swept by any two of the major axes. In other words, the points
 * in each slice (or strand) all need to have one of the X,Y,Z values to
 * be constant.
 * 2. The IsInside method implements the concept of spatial 'insidedness'
 * where other descendents of SpatialObject have a concept of insidedness
 * defined in a rather ad-hoc manner. PolygonGroupSpatialObjects define IsInside
 * to mean that the given point resides in space inside the surface of
 * the PolygonGroupSpatialObject.
 * \ingroup ITKSpatialObjects

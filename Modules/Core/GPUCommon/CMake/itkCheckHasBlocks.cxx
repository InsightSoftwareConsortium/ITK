// Check if blocks can be used for the GPU implementation.
// Blocks are a nonstandard extension added by Apple to their
// implementations of the C, C++, and Objective-C programming languages.
// Apple has implemented blocks both in their own branch of the
// GNU Compiler Collection and in the Clang LLVM compiler front end.
// For example macports gcc will not support Blocks on OS X because
// it does not use Apple's headers.
// You can recompile your gcc on OS X if needed, using:
// --with-native-system-header-dir=/usr/include
// --with-sysroot=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk

// This code was tested on OS X 10.10 with:
// Apple LLVM version 6.0 (clang-600.0.54): Compiles
// Homebrew gcc 4.9.2: Compiles
// Macports gcc 4.9.2: Fails
// Macports gcc 4.9.2: with native headers : Compiles

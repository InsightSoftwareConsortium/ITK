/**
 * \class NeighborhoodIterator
 *
 * \brief Defines iteration of a local N-dimensional neighborhood of pixels
 * across an itk::Image.
 *
 * This class is a loose extension of the Standard Template Library (STL)
 * bi-directional iterator concept to \em masks of pixel neighborhoods within
 * itk::Image objects.  This NeighborhoodIterator base class defines simple
 * forward and reverse iteration of an N-dimensional neighborhood mask
 * across an image.  Elements within the mask can be accessed like elements
 * within an array.
 *
 * NeighborhoodIterators are designed to encapsulate some of the complexity of
 * working with image neighborhoods, complexity that would otherwise have to be
 * managed at the algorithmic level.  Use NeighborhoodIterators to simplify
 * writing algorithms that perform geometrically localized operations on images
 * (for example, convolution and morphological operations).
 *
 * To motivate the discussion of NeighborhoodIterators and their use in
 * Itk, consider the following code that takes directional derivatives at each
 * point in an image.
 *
\code
itk::NeighborhoodInnerProduct<ImageType> innerProduct;

itk::DerivativeOperator<ImageType> operator;
 operator->SetOrder(1);
 operator->SetDirection(0);
 operator->CreateDirectional();

itk::NeighborhoodIterator<ImageType>
  iterator(operator->GetRadius(), myImage, myImage->GetRequestedRegion());

iterator.SetToBegin();
while ( ! iterator.IsAtEnd() )
{
  std::cout << "Derivative at index " << iterator.GetIndex() << is <<
    innerProduct(iterator, operator) << std::endl;
  ++iterator;
}
\endcode
 *
 * Most of the work for the programmer in the code above is in setting up for
 * the iteration.  There are three steps.  First an inner product function
 * object is created which will be used to effect convolution with the
 * derivative kernel.  Setting up the derivative kernel, DerivativeOperator,
 * involves setting the order and direction of the derivative.  Finally, we
 * create an iterator over the RequestedRegion of the itk::Image (see Image)
 * using the radius of the derivative kernel as the size.
 *
 * Itk iterators only loosely follow STL conventions.  Notice that instead of
 * asking myImage for myImage.begin() and myImage.end(), iterator.SetToBegin()
 * and iterator.IsAtEnd() are called.  Itk iterators are typically more complex
 * objects than traditional, pointer-style STL iterators, and the increased
 * overhead required to conform to the complete STL API is not always
 * justified.
 *
 * The API for creating and manipulating a NeighborhoodIterator mimics
 * that of the itk::ImageIterators.  Like the itk::ImageIterator, a
 * ConstNeighborhoodIterator is defined on a region of interest in an itk::Image.
 * Iteration is constrained within that region of interest.
 *
 * A NeighborhoodIterator is constructed as a container of pointers (offsets)
 * to a geometric neighborhood of image pixels.  As the central pixel position
 * in the mask is moved around the image, the neighboring pixel pointers
 * (offsets) are moved accordingly.
 *
 * A \em pixel \em neighborhood is defined as a central pixel location and an
 * N-dimensional radius extending outward from that location.
 *
 * Pixels in a neighborhood can be accessed through a NeighborhoodIterator
 * like elements in an array.  For example, a 2D neighborhood with radius 2x1
 * has indices:
 *
\code
0  1  2  3  4
5  6  7  8  9
10 11 12 13 14
\endcode
 *
 * Now suppose a NeighborhoodIterator with the above dimensions is constructed
 * and positioned over a neighborhood of values in an Image:
 *
\code
1.2 1.3 1.8 1.4 1.1
1.8 1.1 0.7 1.0 1.0
2.1 1.9 1.7 1.4 2.0
\endcode
 *
 * Shown below is some sample pixel access code and the values that it returns.
 *
\code
SizeValueType c = (SizeValueType) (iterator.Size() / 2); // get offset of center pixel
SizeValueType s = iterator.GetStride(1);            // y-dimension step size

std::cout << iterator.GetPixel(7)      << std::endl;
std::cout << iterator.GetCenterPixel() << std::endl;
std::cout << iterator.GetPixel(c)      << std::endl;
std::cout << iterator.GetPixel(c-1)    << std::endl;
std::cout << iterator.GetPixel(c-s)    << std::endl;
std::cout << iterator.GetPixel(c-s-1)  << std::endl;
std::cout << *iterator[c]              << std::endl;
\endcode
 *
 * Results:
 *
\code
0.7
0.7
0.7
1.1
1.8
1.3
0.7
\endcode
 *
 * Use of GetPixel() is preferred over the *iterator[] form, and can be used
 * without loss of efficiency in most cases. Some variations (subclasses) of
 * NeighborhoodIterators may exist which do not support the latter
 * API. Corresponding SetPixel() methods exist to modify pixel values in
 * non-const NeighborhoodIterators.
 *
 * NeighborhoodIterators are "bidirectional iterators". They move only in two
 * directions through the data set.  These directions correspond to the layout
 * of the image data in memory and not to spatial directions of the
 * N-dimensional itk::Image.  Iteration always proceeds along the fastest
 * increasing dimension (as defined by the layout of the image data).  For
 * itk::Image this is the first dimension specified (i.e. for 3-dimensional
 * (x,y,z) NeighborhoodIterator proceeds along the x-dimension) (For random
 * access iteration through N-dimensional indices, use
 * RandomAccessNeighborhoodIterator).
 *
 * Each subclass of a ConstNeighborhoodIterator may also define its own
 * mechanism for iteration through an image.  In general, the Iterator does not
 * directly keep track of its spatial location in the image, but uses a set of
 * internal loop variables and offsets to trigger wraps at itk::Image region
 * boundaries, and to identify the end of the itk::Image region.
 *
 * \todo Better support for regions with negative indices.
 * \todo Add Begin() and End() methods?

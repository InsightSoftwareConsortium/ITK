 * \class DerivativeOperator
 * \brief A NeighborhoodOperator for taking an n-th order derivative
 * at a pixel
 *
 * DerivativeOperator's coefficients are a tightest-fitting convolution
 * kernel for calculating the n-th order directional derivative at a pixel.
 * DerivativeOperator is a directional NeighborhoodOperator that should be
 * applied to a Neighborhood or NeighborhoodPointer using the inner product
 * method.
 *
 * An example operator to compute X derivatives of a 2D image can be
 * created with:
   \code
         using DerivativeOperatorType = itk::DerivativeOperator<float, 2>;
         DerivativeOperatorType derivativeOperator;
         derivativeOperator.SetDirection(0); // X dimension
         itk::Size<2> radius;
         radius.Fill(1); // A radius of 1 in both dimensions is a 3x3 operator
         derivativeOperator.CreateToRadius(radius);
   \endcode
 * and creates a kernel that looks like:
   \code
         0        0 0
         0.5  0   -0.5
         0    0   0
   \endcode

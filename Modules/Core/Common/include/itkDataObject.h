/*----------------------------Data Object--------------------------------*/

/**
 *\class DataObject
 * \brief Base class for all data objects in ITK.
 *
 * This is the base class for all data objects in the Insight data
 * processing pipeline. A data object is an object that represents and
 * provides access to data. ProcessObjects (i.e., filters) operate on
 * input data objects, producing new data objects as output.
 * ProcessObject and DataObject are connected together into data flow
 * pipelines.
 *
 * The data flow pipeline architecture requires that DataObjects and
 * ProcessObjects negotiate the flow of information.  When the tail of
 * a pipeline is instructed to Update(), a series of requests are
 * propagated up the pipeline (from a ProcessObject to its inputs
 * (DataObjects), from these inputs to their sources (ProcessObjects),
 * etc.). A call to Update() entails 3 passes up the pipeline (though
 * not all passes will traverse the entire pipeline).  The first pass
 * up the pipeline determines when various components of the pipeline
 * were last modified and hence which components will need to be
 * updated.  As this first pass in unwinding, meta information about
 * the DataObjects (for instance image spacing and data size) are
 * passed down the pipeline.  The second pass up the pipeline
 * propagates a request for a specific piece of information (for
 * instance a sub-region of an image). A request for a piece of a
 * DataObject is propagated to its source, from there to its inputs,
 * etc. allowing each ProcessObject to determine whether (1) it can
 * already satisfy the request (the requested block of data is already
 * available) or (2) the ProcessObject will need to request a new
 * block of data on input to satisfy the output request.  Finally, a
 * pass is made up the pipeline to actually calculate the values for
 * the various blocks of data requested (i.e. pixel values are finally
 * calculated).  This final pass will only traverse up the pipeline as
 * far as the first two passes have identified.  For instance, to
 * satisfy a given request at the tail of a pipeline, only the lower
 * few ProcessObjects may have to re-execute.
 *
 * There are three types of information negotiated by the pipeline
 * (prior to actual calculation of the bulk data): modified times,
 * meta data, and regions.  The modified times keep track of when
 * various data objects were last modified and/updated and the when
 * the various process objects were modified.  The meta data is any
 * extra information about the data object that is not part of the
 * bulk data.  For instance, an Image maintains pixel spacing and
 * origin meta data.  Finally, the pipeline negotiation process passes
 * requests up the pipeline in the form of Regions.  A DataObject can
 * have as many as three regions (which themselves could be considered
 * meta data): LargestPossibleRegion, RequestedRegion, and
 * BufferedRegion.  The LargestPossibleRegion is the entirety of the
 * dataset (for instance how big is the dataset on disk).
 * LargestPossibleRegions are negotiated during the first pass of a
 * pipeline update (via the method
 * ProcessObject::GenerateOutputInformation() which is called from
 * ProcessObject::UpdateOutputInformation().  The RequestedRegion is
 * the amount of the DataObject that is requested by the user or
 * pipeline. RequestedRegions are negotiated during the second pass of
 * a pipeline update (via the methods
 * ProcessObject::EnlargeOutputRequestedRegion(),
 * ProcessObject::GenerateOutputRequestedRegion(),
 * ProcessObject::GenerateInputRequestedRegion() which are called from
 * ProcessObject::PropagateRequestedRegion()). The BufferedRegion is
 * the amount of the DataObject that is currently in memory.
 * BufferedRegions are defined during the final pass of a pipeline
 * update (when ProcessObjects finally calculate the bulk data via the
 * methods ProcessObject::GenerateData() or
 * ProcessObject::DynamicThreadedGenerateData() which are called by
 * ProcessObject::UpdateOutputData()). These three regions can be
 * different but must satisfy the relationship RequestedRegion <=
 * BufferedRegion <= LargestPossibleRegion. For instance, an Image
 * could be 512x512x200 on disk (LargestPossibleRegion) but the
 * application may only have a 256x256x50 section of the dataset in
 * memory (BufferedRegion) and the user wants to operate on a
 * 100x100x1 section of the buffer (RequestedRegion).
 *
 * Region negotiation is not applicable for all types of DataObjects.
 * For instance, an EquivalencyTable of segmentation labels can be
 * passed from ProcessObject to ProcessObject as any other DataObject
 * but an EquivalencyTable does not support the concept of a
 * sub-region. Therefore, the region negotiations at the DataObject
 * (superclass) level are implemented as "abstract" concepts (not to
 * be confused with a C++ abstract methods), allowing subclasses to
 * provide specialized implementations on an as needed basis. There
 * are five methods provided in DataObject that a subclass of
 * DataObject may have to override for that particular type of
 * DataObject to flow through the pipeline. These methods should only
 * have to be specialized for DataObjects that do support
 * regions. These methods are:
 *
 * void UpdateOutputInformation(): This method implements the first
 * pass of the pipeline update mechanism outlined above.  It is
 * responsible for identifying when upstream components of the
 * pipeline have been change (ModifiedTimes and Pipeline
 * ModifiedTimes) and is responsible for propagating meta data through
 * the pipeline. In the simplest case, this method simply calls the
 * DataObject's source's UpdateOutputInformation() method (this is the
 * default implementation). For DataObjects that support streaming,
 * this method also propagates LargestPossibleRegions to downstream
 * ProcessObjects.
 *
 * bool VerifyRequestedRegion(): Verify that the RequestedRegion is
 * within the LargestPossibleRegion.  For DataObjects that do not
 * support Regions, this method always returns true.
 *
 * bool RequestedRegionIsOutsideOfTheBufferedRegion(): Determine
 * whether the RequestedRegion is outside of the current
 * BufferedRegion. This method is used by the second pass of a
 * pipeline update outlined above.  It is used to determine whether a
 * filter needs to re-execute in order to satisfy a given request. For
 * DataObjects that do not support Regions, this method always returns
 * false. By always returning false, these types of DataObjects will
 * update solely on the basis of modified times (whereas Images
 * update based on either modified times or the RequestedRegion
 * needs). If this method always returned true, the DataObject would
 * be updated on every single call to Update() (not recommended).
 *
 * void SetRequestedRegion(const DataObject *): Sets the RequestedRegion of
 * this DataObject to match the RequestedRegion of the DataObject that
 * is passed in as a parameter. This method is used by
 * ProcessObject::GenerateOutputRequestedRegion() and by
 * ProcessObject::SetNthOutput().  In the former case, it used as an
 * abstract API so that a ProcessObject can copy a requested region
 * from one output to all its outputs without knowing the particular
 * subclass of DataObject.  In the latter case, it used when a
 * ProcessObject has to create an output object to replace one of its
 * outputs (and needs to copy the former object's RequestedRegion). In
 * either case, it allows ProcessObject to perform these actions
 * without knowing the specifics about the particular subclass of
 * DataObject. For DataObjects that do not support Regions, this
 * method does nothing.
 *
 * void SetRequestedRegionToLargestPossibleRegion(): Sets the
 * RequestedRegion of this DataObject to match its
 * LargestPossibleRegion.  This method is used to force a filter to
 * produce all of its output on the next call to Update(). For
 * DataObjects that do not support Regions, this method does nothing.

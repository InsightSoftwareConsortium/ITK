/** \class EquivalencyTable
 * \brief Hash table to manage integral label equivalencies
 *
 * EquivalencyTable is a hash table for recording equivalencies among
 * unsigned long integer values. EquivalencyTable can store recursive
 * relationships (8=7, 7=6, 6=5, ...) or be "flattened" to eliminate
 * recursion.  The table uses an efficient algorithm for eliminating
 * redundancy and preventing circular dependencies.
 *
 * \par
 * In the context of the watershed segmentation algorithm
 * (itk::WatershedImageFilter), this table is used to store connections
 * identified among image segments and as the input to
 * itk::watershed::Relabeler.

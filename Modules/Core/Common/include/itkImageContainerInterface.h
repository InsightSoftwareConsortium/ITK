/** \class ImageContainerInterface
 *  \brief Used for reference when writing containers conforming to
 *         this interface.
 *
 * This should only be used for reference when writing containers
 * conforming to this interface.  ITK uses generic programming to
 * allow container type substitution, so polymorphism is not needed to
 * use containers through this interface.  This means that a container
 * conforming to this interface need not be derived from it, and that
 * their methods should not be virtual.  However, the container must
 * derive from Object in order to support the reference counting,
 * modification time, and debug information required by this
 * interface.
 *
 * Note that many comments refer to a "default element" or "default element
 * value".  This value is equal to the default constructor of the
 * Element type.  Also note that all non-const methods assume that the
 * container was modified, and update the modification time.
 *
 * \tparam TElementIdentifier A type that shall be used to index the
 * container. It must have a < operator defined for ordering.
 *
 * \tparam TElement The element type stored in the container.

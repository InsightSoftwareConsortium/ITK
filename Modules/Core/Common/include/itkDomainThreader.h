/** \class DomainThreader
 *  \brief Multi-threaded processing on a domain by processing sub-domains per
 *  thread.
 *
 *  This class uses a ThreadedDomainPartitioner as a helper to split the
 *  domain into subdomains.  Each subdomain is then processed in the
 *  \c ThreadedExecution method.
 *
 *  The data on which to perform the processing is assumed to be members
 *  of an associating class.  Therefore, to perform a threaded operation in a
 *  class, the associating class usually will declare derived versions of this
 *  class as a friend class.
 *
 *  To use this class, at a minimum,
 *  \li Inherit from it.
 *  \li Implement ThreadedExecution.
 *  \li Create a member instance.
 *  \li Run with m_DomainThreader->Execute( this, domain );
 *
 *  If a 'threaded method' is desired to perform some data processing in a
 *  class, a derived version of this class can be defined to perform the threaded operation.
 *  Since a threaded operation is relatively complex compared to a simple serial
 *  operation, a class instead of a simple method is required.  Inside this
 *  class, the method to partition the data is handled, the logic for
 *  determining the number of threads is determined, and operations surrounding
 *  the threading are encapsulated into the class with the
 *  \c DetermineNumberOfThreadsToUse, \c BeforeThreadedExecution, \c ThreadedExecution,
 *  and \c AfterThreadedExecution virtual methods.
 *
 *  \tparam TDomainPartitioner A class that inherits from
 *  ThreadedDomainPartitioner.
 *  \tparam TAssociate  The associated class that uses a derived version of
 *  this class as a "threaded method".  The associated class usually declares
 *  derived version of this class as nested classes so there is easy access to
 *  its protected and private members in ThreadedExecution.

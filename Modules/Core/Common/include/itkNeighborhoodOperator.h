/** \class NeighborhoodOperator
 * \brief Virtual class that defines a common interface to all
 *        neighborhood operator subtypes.
 *
 * A NeighborhoodOperator is a set of pixel values that can be applied to a
 * Neighborhood to perform a user-defined operation (i.e. convolution kernel,
 * morphological structuring element).  A NeighborhoodOperator is itself a
 * specialized Neighborhood, with functionality to generate its coefficients
 * according to user-defined parameters.  Because the operator is a subclass
 * of Neighborhood, it is a valid operand in any of the operations
 * defined on the Neighborhood object (convolution, inner product, etc.).
 *
 * NeighborhoodOperator is a pure virtual object that must be
 * subclassed to be used.  A user's subclass must implement two methods:
 *
 * (1) GenerateCoefficients -- the algorithm that computes the scalar
 *   coefficients of the operator.
 *
 * (2) Fill -- the algorithm that places the scalar coefficients into
 *   the memory buffer of the operator (arranges them spatially in the
 *   neighborhood).
 *
 * NeighborhoodOperator supports the concept of a "directional operator."
 * A directional operator is defined in this context to be an operator
 * that is applied along a single dimension.  Examples of this type of
 * operator are directional derivatives and the individual, directional
 * components of separable processes such as Gaussian smoothing.
 *
 * How a NeighborhoodOperator is applied to data is up to the user who
 * defines it.  One possible use of an operator would be to take its
 * inner product with a neighborhood of values to produce
 * a scalar result.  This process effects convolution when applied to
 * successive neighborhoods across a region of interest in an image.

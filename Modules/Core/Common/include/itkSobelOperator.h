/**
 * \class SobelOperator
 *
 * \brief A NeighborhoodOperator for performing a directional Sobel
 * edge-detection operation at a pixel location.
 *
 * SobelOperator is a directional NeighborhoodOperator that should be
 * applied a NeighborhoodIterator using the NeighborhoodInnerProduct
 * method. To create the operator:
 *
 * 1) Set the direction by calling  \code SetDirection \endcode
 * 2) call
   \code
   itk::Size<2> radius;
   radius.Fill(1);
   sobelOperator.CreateToRadius(radius);
   \endcode
 * 3) You may optionally scale the coefficients of this operator using the
 * \code ScaleCoefficients \endcode method.  This is useful if you
 * want to take the spacing of the image into account when computing
 * the edge strength.  Apply the scaling only after calling to
 * \code CreateToRadius \endcode.
 *
 * The Sobel Operator in vertical direction for 2 dimensions is
 * \verbatim
 *             -1  -2  -1
 *             0    0   0
 *             1    2   1
 *
 * \endverbatim
 * The Sobel Operator in horizontal direction is for 2 dimensions is
 * \verbatim
 *             -1   0   1
 *             -2   0   2
 *             -1   0   1
 * \endverbatim
 *
 * The current implementation of the Sobel operator is for 2 and 3 dimensions only.
 * The ND version is planned for future releases.
 *
 * The extension to 3D is from the publication
 *  "Irwin Sobel. An Isotropic 3x3x3 Volume Gradient Operator.
 * Technical report, Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, April 1995."
 *
 * The Sobel operator in 3D has the kernel
 *
 * \verbatim
 * -1 -3 -1   0 0 0  1 3 1
 * -3 -6 -3   0 0 0  3 6 3
 * -1 -3 -1   0 0 0  1 3 1
 *
 *    x-1       x     x+1
 * \endverbatim
 *
 * The \c x kernel is just rotated as required to obtain the kernel in the
 * \c y and \c z directions.
 *
 * \note SobelOperator does not have any user-declared "special member function",
 * following the C++ Rule of Zero: the compiler will generate them if necessary.

/** \class IterationReporter
 * \brief Implements iterations tracking for a filter.
 *
 * This is a utility class for use by filter implementations in
 * GenerateData() and ThreadedGenerateData().
 *
 * This class is intended to be used in iterative filter for which
 * a progress cannot be stablished. These filters run until an stopping
 * criterion is reached and it is not possible to anticipate how long
 * it will take to get to the stopping point.
 *
 * This class is constructed before entering the iteration loop in the
 * filter. The CompletedStep() method should be called at every iteration.
 * The reporter will count the number of calls and will invoke an
 * IterationEvent every certain number of calls. The default period
 * is 100.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 *   IterationReporter iteration(this, threadId, 100);
 *
 *   for( each pixel )
 *     {
 *     ...
 *     iteration.CompletedStep();
 *     }
 *
 * When used in a non-threaded filter, the threadId argument should be 0.
 * \ingroup ITKCommon

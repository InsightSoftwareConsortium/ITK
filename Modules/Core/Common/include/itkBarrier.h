/**
 * \class Barrier
 * \brief Standard barrier class implementation for synchronizing the execution
 * of threads.
 *
 * A barrier class is used to synchronize threaded execution by allowing
 * threads to block until each has reached a desired state. As each thread
 * enters the barrier it blocks. When all threads have entered the barrier,
 * all released and continue to execute.
 *
 * A thread enters the barrier by calling Barrier::Wait() on the barrier
 * class. To set up a barrier class, call Barrier::Initialize(unsigned int),
 * specifying the number of waiting threads that will trigger a release of the
 * barrier as the argument.
 *
 * NOTE: This class is only compatible with PlatformMultiThreader!
 *
 * NOTE: This class is deprecated since ITK 5.0!

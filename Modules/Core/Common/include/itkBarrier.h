/**
 * \class Barrier
 * \brief Standard barrier class implementation for synchronizing the execution
 * of threads.
 *
 * A barrier class is used to synchronize threaded execution by allowing
 * threads to block until each has reached a desired state.  As each thread
 * enters the barrier it blocks. When all threads have entered the barrier,
 * all released and continue to execute.
 *
 * A thread enters the barrier by calling Wait() on the barrier class.
 * To set up a barrier class, call Initialize(n) where n is the number of
 * waiting threads that will trigger a release of the barrier.

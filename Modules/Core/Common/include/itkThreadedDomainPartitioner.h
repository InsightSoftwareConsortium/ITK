 *  \brief Virtual base class for partitioning a domain into subsets to be
 *  processed per thread when parallel processing.
 *
 * \tparam TDomain The type of the domain to be partitioned.
 *
 * \c PartitionDomain is a method to split the domain into
 * non-overlapping pieces for threading. It must be overridden by derived
 * classes to provide the particular functionality required for
 * \c TDomain type.
 *
 * Subclasses of this class are typically used as template arguments to a DomainThreader.

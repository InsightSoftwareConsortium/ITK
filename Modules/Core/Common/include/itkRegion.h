/** \class Region
 * \brief A region represents some portion or piece of data.
 *
 * Region is an abstract class that represents some portion or
 * piece of a DataObject. A region is used by the pipeline when
 * processing just a portion of the data, either because 1) memory
 * limits dictate that the pipeline cannot fit the entire dataset
 * into memory; 2) the user has requested that only a piece of the
 * dataset is to be processed; or 3) parallel (multi-threaded)
 * processing of the data is required.
 *
 * There are two types of regions in itk: a structured region that
 * specifies a rectangular piece of an image (ImageRegion), and a
 * unstructured region that specifies piece i of N total pieces
 * (MeshRegion). Depending on the filter (its input and output
 * types, and its position in the pipeline), ImageRegion or MeshRegion
 * will be used to describe the region.
 *
 * Region is a light-weight object and not reference counted. This
 * means that is behaves differently than ITK classes that are
 * reference counted. For example, smart pointer access is not
 * provided, and the (subclasses') constructor, destructor,
 * copy constructor and operator= are all public.

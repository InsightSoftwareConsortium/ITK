/**
 * \class Boolean
 *
 * \brief An alternative to bool for additional thread safety
 *
 * The class `Boolean` provides an alternative to `bool`. `std::vector<bool>` is not thread safe due to the possibility
 * of multiple bits being packed together in the same memory location.  std::vector<Boolean> does not have such a space
 * optimization. std::vector<Boolean> is semantically like `std::vector<bool>`, but unlike `std::vector<bool>`, it does
 * "avoid data races when the contents of the contained object in different elements in the same container [...] are
 * modified concurrently", according to the C++ Standard, section [container.requirements.dataraces], "Container data
 * races".

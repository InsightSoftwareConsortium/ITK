/** The type alias `BooleanStdVectorType` provides an alternative to `std::vector<bool>`. `std::vector<bool>` is not
 * thread safe due to the possibility of multiple bits being packed together in the same memory location.
 * BooleanStdVectorType does not have such a space optimization. BooleanStdVectorType is semantically like
 * `std::vector<bool>`, but unlike `std::vector<bool>`, it does "avoid data races when the contents of the contained
 * object in different elements in the same container [...] are modified concurrently", according to the C++ Standard,
 * section [container.requirements.dataraces], "Container data races".

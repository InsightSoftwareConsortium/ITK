/** \class NeighborhoodInnerProduct
 *  \brief Defines the inner product operation between an
 *         Neighborhood and a NeighborhoodOperator.
 *
 * This class defines the inner product operation between an
 * itk::Neighborhood and an itk::NeighborhoodOperator.  The
 * operator() method is overloaded to support various types of
 * neighborhoods as well as inner products with slices of
 * neighborhoods.
 *
 * \tparam TImage         Type of image on which the class operates.
 * \tparam TOperator      The value type of the operator (defaults to
 * the image pixel type).
 * \tparam TComputation   The value type used as the return type of the
 * inner product calculation (defaults to the operator type).

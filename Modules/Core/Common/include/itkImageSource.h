/** \class ImageSource
 *  \brief Base class for all process objects that output image data.
 *
 * ImageSource is the base class for all process objects that output
 * image data. Specifically, this class defines the GetOutput() method
 * that returns a pointer to the output image. The class also defines
 * some internal private data members that are used to manage streaming
 * of data.
 *
 * Memory management in an ImageSource is slightly different than a
 * standard ProcessObject.  ProcessObject's always release the bulk
 * data associated with their output prior to GenerateData() being
 * called. ImageSources default to not releasing the bulk data incase
 * that particular memory block is large enough to hold the new output
 * values.  This avoids unnecessary deallocation/allocation
 * sequences. ImageSource's can be forced to use a memory management
 * model similar to the default ProcessObject behaviour by calling
 * ProcessObject::ReleaseDataBeforeUpdateFlagOn().  A user may want to
 * set this flag to limit peak memory usage during a pipeline update.

   * By default, the largest possible region is requested.
   *
   * For Filters which have multiple outputs of different types, the
   * GetOutput() method assumes the output is of OutputImageType. For
   * the GetOutput(unsigned int) method, a dynamic_cast is performed
   * incase the filter has outputs of different types or image
   * types. Derived classes should have names get methods for these

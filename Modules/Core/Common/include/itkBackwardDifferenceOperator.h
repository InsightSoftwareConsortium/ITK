 * \class BackwardDifferenceOperator
 * \brief Operator whose inner product with a neighborhood returns
 * a "half" derivative at the center of the neighborhood.
 *
 * BackwardDifferenceOperator uses backward differences
 * i.e. F(x) - F(x-1) to calculate a "half" derivative useful, among
 * other things, in solving differential equations. It is a directional
 * NeighborhoodOperator that should be applied to a Neighborhood using the
 * inner product.

/**
 * \class FiniteDifferenceFunction
 *
 * This class is a component object of the finite difference solver hierarchy
 * (see FiniteDifferenceImageFilter).  It defines a generic interface for a
 * function object that computes a single scalar value from a neighborhood of
 * values.  Examples of the application of this class are the various flavors
 * of AnisotropicDiffusionFunction and LevelSetFunction objects.
 *
 * These functions calculate the incremental change at a pixel in the solution
 * image from one iteration of the Partial Differential Equation (PDE) solver to
 * the next.
 *
 * \par
 * Subclasses of FiniteDifferenceImageFilter (solvers) call the
 * ComputeUpdate() method of this class to compute \f$ \Delta u^n_{\mathbf{i}}
 * \f$ at each \f$ \mathbf{i} \f$  in \f$ u \f$.  Because the size of the time
 * step for each iteration of the p.d.e. solution depends on the particular
 * calculations done, this function object is also responsible for computing
 * that time step (see ComputeGlobalTimeStep() ).
 *
 * \par How to use this class
 * FiniteDifferenceFunction must be subclassed to add functionality for
 * ComputeUpdate, ComputeGlobalTimeStep, and Get/ReleaseGlobalDataPointer.
 *
 * \par A note on thread safety.
 * The ComputeUpdate() methods of this filter are declared as const to enforce
 * thread-safety during execution of FiniteDifferenceImageFilter solver
 * algorithms.  The InitializeIteration() method is intended to provide a safe
 * way to modify the state of the object between threaded calculations of
 * solvers.
 *
 * \todo Possibly subclass this object from Function.  Stumbling blocks here
 * are the specialized api of FiniteDifferenceFunction.

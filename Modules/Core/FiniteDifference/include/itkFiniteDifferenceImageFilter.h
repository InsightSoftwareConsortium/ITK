 * \class FiniteDifferenceImageFilter
 *
 * \par The Finite Difference Solver Hierarchy
 *
 * \par
 * This is an overview of the Finite Difference Solver (FDS) framework. The
 * FDS framework is a set of classes for creating filters to solve partial
 * differential equations on images using an iterative, finite difference
 * update scheme.
 *
 * \par
 * The high-level algorithm implemented by the framework can be described by
 * the following pseudocode.
 *
   \code
    WHILE NOT convergence:
       FOR ALL pixels i
          time_step = calculate_change(i)
          update(i, time_step)
   \endcode
 *
 * \par
 * The following equation describes update \f$ n+1 \f$ at pixel \f$ i \f$ on
 * discrete image \f$ u \f$ :
 *
 * \f[ u_{\mathbf{i}}^{n+1}=u^n_{\mathbf{i}}+\Delta u^n_{\mathbf{i}}\Delta t \f]
 *
 * \par Component objects
 * The FDS hierarchy is comprised of two component object types, variations of
 * which are designed to be plugged together to create filters for different
 * applications.  At the process level are the "solver" objects, which are
 * subclasses of FiniteDifferenceImageFilter. Solver objects are filters that
 * take image inputs and produce image outputs.  Solver objects require a
 * FiniteDifferenceFunction object to perform the calculation at each
 * image pixel during iteration. These specialized function objects are
 * subclasses of FiniteDifferenceFunction. FiniteDifferenceFunction take a
 * neighborhood of pixels as input (in the form of an
 * itk::NeighborhoodIterator) and produce a scalar valued result.
 *
 * \par
 * Filters for different applications are created by defining a function object
 * to handle the numerical calculations and choosing (or creating) a solver
 * object that reflects the requirements and constraints of the application.
 *
 * For example, anisotropic diffusion filters are created by plugging
 * anisotropic diffusion functions into the DenseFiniteDifferenceImageFilter.
 *
 * The separation between function object and solver object allows us to
 * create, for example, sparse-field, dense-field, and narrow-band
 * implementations of a level-set surface evolution filter can all be
 * constructed by plugging the same function object into three different,
 * specialized solvers.
 *
 * \par Creating new filters in this hierarchy
 * The procedure for creating a filter within the FDS hierarchy is to identify
 * all the virtual methods that need to be defined for your particular
 * application.  In the simplest case, a filter needs only to instantiate a
 * specific function object and define some halting criteria. For more
 * complicated applications, you may need to define a specialized type of
 * iteration scheme or updating procedure in a higher-level solver object.
 *
 * \par
 * Some simple examples are the specific subclasses of
 * AnisotropicDiffusionImageFilter. The leaves of the anisotropic diffusion
 * filter tree only define the function object they use for their particular
 * flavor of diffusion. See CurvatureAnisotropicDiffusionImageFilter and
 * GradientAnisotropicDiffusionImageFilter for details.
 *
 * \par FiniteDifferenceImageFilter
 * This class defines the generic solver API at the top level of the FDS
 * framework. FiniteDifferenceImageFilter is an abstract class that implements
 * the generic, high-level algorithm (described above).
 *
 * \par Inputs and Outputs
 * This filter is an ImageToImage filter. Depending on the specific
 * subclass implementation, finite difference image filters may process a
 * variety of image types. The input to the filter is the initial
 * value of \f$ u \f$ and the output of the filter is the solution to the
 * P.D.E.
 *
 * \par How to use this class
 * GenerateData() relies on several virtual methods that must be defined by a
 * subclass.
 * Specifically:
 * \li \em AllocateUpdateBuffer()
 * \li \em ApplyUpdate()
 * \li \em CalculateChange()
 * \li \em Halt().
 * To create a finite difference solver, implement a subclass to define these methods.
 *
 * \par
 * Note that there is no fixed container type for the buffer used to hold
 * the update \f$ \Delta \f$. The container might be another image, or simply
 * a list of values.  AllocateUpdateBuffer is responsible for creating the
 * \f$ \Delta \f$ container.  CalculateChange populates this buffer and
 * ApplyUpdate adds the buffer values to the output image (solution). The
 * boolean Halt() (or ThreadedHalt()) method returns a true value to stop iteration.

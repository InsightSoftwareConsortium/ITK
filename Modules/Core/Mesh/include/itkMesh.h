/** \class Mesh
 * \brief Implements the N-dimensional mesh structure.
 *
 * \par Overview
 * Mesh implements the N-dimensional mesh structure for ITK.  It provides
 * an API to perform operations on points, cells, boundaries, etc., but
 * does not tie down the underlying implementation and storage.  A
 * "MeshTraits" structure is used to define the container and identifier
 * types that will be used to access the mesh.  See DefaultStaticMeshTraits
 * for the set of type definitions needed.  All types that are defined
 * in the "MeshTraits" structure will have duplicate type alias in the resulting
 * mesh itself.
 *
 * Mesh is an adaptive, evolving structure. Typically points and cells
 * are created, with the cells referring to their defining points. If
 * additional topological information is required, then BuildCellLinks() is
 * called and links from the points back to the cells that use them are
 * created. This allows implicit topological information about the faces
 * and edges of the cells to be determined. (For example, a "face" neighbor
 * to a cell can be determined by intersection the sets of cells that use
 * the points defining the face. This is an inherent assumption on the
 * manifold relationship of the cells in the mesh.) In some cases, either
 * because the mesh is non-manifold, because we wish to explicitly store
 * information with the faces and edges of the mesh, or because performance
 * requirements demand that boundaries are explicitly represented (the set
 * intersection does not need to be performed); then Mesh can be further
 * extended by adding explicit boundary assignments.
 *
 * \par Usage
 * Mesh has three template parameters.  The first is the pixel type, or the
 * type of data stored (optionally) with points, cells, and/or boundaries.
 * The second is the geometric dimension of the points defining the mesh. This
 * also limits the maximum topological dimension of the cells that can be
 * inserted. The third template parameter is the "MeshTraits" structure
 * controlling type information for the mesh.  Most users will be happy
 * with the defaults, and will not have to worry about this third argument.
 *
 * One of the most important parts of using this mesh is how to create
 * cells to insert into it.  The cells for the mesh take two template
 * parameters.  The first is the pixel type, and should correspond
 * exactly to that type given to the mesh.  The second is a
 * "CellTraits" which holds a sub-set of the "MeshTraits" structure
 * definitions, and is also a member of them.  Any cell which is to be
 * inserted to a mesh should have MeshTraits::CellTraits as its second
 * template parameter.
 *
 * Template parameters for Mesh:
 *
 * TPixelType =
 *     The type stored as data for an entity (cell, point, or boundary).
 *
 * TMeshTraits =
 *     Type information structure for the mesh.

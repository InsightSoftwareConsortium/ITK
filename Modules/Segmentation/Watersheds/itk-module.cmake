set(DOCUMENTATION "This module contains classes related to watershed
segmentation. The watershed algorithm proceeds in several steps. First, an initial
classification of all points into catchment basin regions is done by tracing
each point down its path of steepest descent to a local minima. Next,
neighboring regions and the boundaries between them are analyzed according
to some saliency measure (such as minimum boundary height) to produce a
tree of merges among adjacent regions.  These merges occur at different
maximum saliency values.  Finally, a label images are generated from the merge
tree.

This module also contains classes related to marker-based watershed
segmentation. For more information, see the Insight Journal article:

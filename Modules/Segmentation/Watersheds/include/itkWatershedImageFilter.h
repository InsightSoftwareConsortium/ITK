/** \class WatershedImageFilter
 *  \brief A low-level image analysis algorithm that automatically produces a
 *   hierarchy of segmented, labeled images from a scalar-valued image input.
 *
 * \par Overview and terminology
 * \par
 * This filter implements a non-streaming version of an image segmentation
 * algorithm commonly known as "watershed segmentation".   Watershed
 * segmentation gets its name from the manner in which the algorithm  segments
 * regions into catchment basins. If a function \f$ f \f$ is a continuous
 * height function defined over an image domain, then a catchment basin is
 * defined as the set of points whose paths of steepest descent terminate at
 * the same local minimum of \f$ f \f$.
 *
 * \par
 * The choice of height function (input) depends on the application, and the
 * basic watershed algorithm operates independently of that choice. For
 * intensity-based image data, you might typically use some sort of gradient
 * magnitude calculation as input. (see itk::GradientMagnitudeImageFilter)
 *
 * \par
 * The watershed algorithm proceeds in several steps. First, an initial
 * classification of all points into catchment basin regions is done by tracing
 * each point down its path of steepest descent to a local minima. Next,
 * neighboring regions and the boundaries between them are analyzed according
 * to  some saliency measure (such as minimum boundary height) to produce a
 * tree of merges among adjacent regions.  These merges occur at different
 * maximum saliency values.  The collective set of all possible merges up to a
 * specified saliency "flood level" is referred to in this documentation as a
 * "merge tree".  Metaphorically, the flood level is a value that reflects
 * the amount of precipitation that is rained into the catchment basins.  As
 * the flood level rises, boundaries between adjacent segments erode and those
 * segments merge.  The minimum value of the flood level is zero and the
 * maximum value is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the
 * input image.
 *
 * \par
 * Note that once the initial analysis and segmentation is done to produce
 * the merge tree, it is trivial to produce a hierarchy of labeled images in
 * constant time.  The complexity of the algorithm is in the computation
 * of the merge tree.  Once that tree has been created, the initial segmented
 * image can be relabeled to reflect any maximum saliency value found in the
 * tree by simply identifying a subset of segment merges from the tree.
 *
 * \par Implementational details
 * This filter is a wrapper for several lower level process objects (watershed
 * algorithm components in the namespace "watershed").  For a more complete
 * picture of the implementation, refer to the documentation of those components.
 * The component classes were designed to operate in either a data-streaming or
 * a non-data-streaming mode.  The pipeline constructed in this class'
 * GenerateData() method does not support streaming, but is the common use case
 * for the components.
 *
 * \par Description of the input to this filter
 * The input to this filter is a scalar itk::Image of any dimensionality.  This
 * input image is assumed to represent some sort of height function or edge map
 * based on the original image that you want to segment (such as would be
 * produced by itk::GradientMagnitudeImageFilter).  This filter does not do any
 * pre-processing on its input other than a thresholding step. The algorithm
 * does not explicitly require that the input be of any particular data type,
 * but floating point or double precision data is recommended.
 *
 * \par
 * The recommended pre-processing for scalar image input to this algorithm is
 * to use one of the itk::AnisotropicDiffusionImageFilter subclasses to smooth
 * the original image and then perform some sort of edge calculation based on
 * gradients or curvature.
 *
 * \par Description of the output of this filter
 * This filter will produce an itk::Image of IdentifierType integer type and of
 * the same dimensionality as the input image.  The IdentifierType output image
 * is referred to as the "labeled image" in this documentation.  Each pixel
 * in the image is assigned an IdentifierType integer label that groups it
 * within a connected region.
 *
 * \par Some notes on filter parameters
 * Two parameters control the output of this filter, Threshold and Level.  The
 * units of both parameters are percentage points of the maximum height value
 * in the input.
 *
 * \par
 * Threshold is used to set the absolute minimum height
 * value used during processing. Raising this threshold percentage effectively
 * decreases the number of local minima in the input, resulting in an initial
 * segmentation with fewer regions.  The assumption is that the shallow regions
 * that thresholding removes are of of less interest.
 *
 * \par
 * The Level parameter controls the depth of metaphorical flooding of the
 * image. That is, it sets the maximum saliency value of interest in the
 * result. Raising and lowering the Level influences the number of segments in
 * the basic segmentation that are merged to produce the final output.  A level
 * of 1.0 is analogous to flooding the image up to a depth that is 100 percent
 * of the maximum value in the image.  A level of 0.0 produces the basic
 * segmentation, which will typically be very oversegmented.  Level values of
 * interest are typically low (i.e. less than about 0.40 or 40% ), since higher
 * values quickly start to undersegment the image.
 *
 * \par
 * The Level parameter can be used to create a hierarchy of output images in
 * constant time once an initial segmentation is done.  A typical scenario
 * might go like this: For the initial execution of the filter, set the Level
 * to the maximum saliency value that you anticipate might be of interest. Once
 * the initial Update() of this process object has finished, the Level can be
 * manipulated anywhere below the initial setting without triggering a full
 * update of the segmentation mini-pipeline.  All that is now be required to
 * produce the new output is a simple relabeling of the output image.
 *
 * \par
 * Threshold and Level parameters are controlled through the class'
 * Get/SetThreshold() and Get/SetLevel() methods.

/**
 *\class VotingBinaryIterativeHoleFillingImageFilter
 * \brief Fills in holes and cavities by iteratively applying a voting operation.
 *
 * This filter uses internally the VotingBinaryHoleFillingImageFilter, and runs
 * it iteratively until no pixels are being changed or until it reaches the
 * maximum number of iterations. The purpose of the filter is to fill in holes
 * of medium size (tens of pixels in radius). In principle the number of
 * iterations is related to the size of the holes to be filled in. The larger
 * the holes, the more iteration must be run with this filter in order to fill
 * in the full hole. The size of the neighborhood is also related to the
 * curvature of the hole borders and therefore the hole size. Note that as a
 * collateral effect this filter may also fill in cavities in the external side
 * of structures.
 *
 * This filter is templated over a single image type because the output image
 * type must be the same as the input image type. This is required in order to
 * make the iterations possible, since the output image of one iteration is
 * taken as the input image for the next iteration.

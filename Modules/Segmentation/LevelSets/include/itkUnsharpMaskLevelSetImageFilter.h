/**
 * \class UnsharpMaskLevelSetImageFilter
 *
 * \brief This class implements a detail enhancing filter by making use of the
 * 4th-order level set isotropic diffusion (smoothing) PDE.
 *
 * \par INPUT and OUTPUT
 * This is a volume to volume filter; however, it is meant to process (smooth)
 * surfaces. The input surface is an isosurface of the input volume. The
 * isosurface value to be processed can be set by calling SetIsoSurfaceValue
 * (default is 0). The output surface is the 0-isosurface of the output volume,
 * regardless of the input isosurface value. To visualize the input/output
 * surfaces to this filter a mesh extraction method such as marching cubes can
 * be used.
 *
 * \par
 * This filter is an example of how the 4th order level set PDE framework can
 * be used for general purpose surface processing. It is motivated by unsharp
 * masking from image processing which is a way of enhancing detail. This
 * filter acts much like the IsotropicFourthOrderLevelSetImageFilter because it
 * first smoothes the normal vectors via isotropic diffusion. However, as a
 * post-processing step we extrapolate from the original normals in the
 * direction opposite to the new processes normals. By refitting the surface to
 * these extrapolated vectors we achieve detail enhancement. This process is
 * not the same as running the isotropic diffusion process in reverse.
 *
 * \par IMPORTANT
 * Because this filters enhances details on the surface, it will also amplify
 * noise! This filter is provided only as an example of graphics oriented
 * post-processing. Do not use it on noisy data.
 *
 * \par PARAMETERS
 * As mentioned before, the IsoSurfaceValue parameter chooses which isosurface
 * of the input to process. The MaxFilterIterations parameter determine the
 * number of iterations for which this filter will run. Since, this filter
 * enhances detail AND noise MaxFilterIterations above a couple of hundred are
 * unreasonable. Finally NormalProcessUnsharpWeight controls the amount of
 * extrapolation (or equivalently the amount of detail enhancement). This value
 * should be in the range [0.1,1] for reasonable results.

/**   \class LaplacianSegmentationLevelSetImageFilter
 *    \brief Segments structures in images based on a second derivative image features.
 *
 *   \par IMPORTANT
 *   The SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter class and the
 *   LaplacianSegmentationLevelSetFunction class contain additional information necessary
 *   to the full understanding of how to use this filter.
 *
 *    \par OVERVIEW
 *    This class is a level set method segmentation filter.  It constructs a
 *    speed function which is zero at image edges as detected by a Laplacian
 *    filter.  The evolving level set front will therefore tend to lock
 *    onto zero crossings in the image.  The level set front moves fastest near
 *    edges.
 *
 *   \par
 *   The Laplacian segmentation filter is intended primarily as a tool for
 *   refining existing segmentations.  The initial isosurface (as given in the
 *   seed input image) should ideally be very close to the segmentation
 *   boundary of interest.  The idea is that a rough segmentation can be
 *   refined by allowing the isosurface to deform slightly to achieve a better
 *   fit to the edge features of an image.  One example of such an application
 *   is to refine the output of a hand segmented image.
 *
 *   \par
 *   Because values in the Laplacian feature image will tend to be low except
 *   near edge features, this filter is not effective for segmenting large
 *   image regions from small seed surfaces.
 *
 *
 *    \par INPUTS
 *    This filter requires two inputs.  The first input is a seed
 *    image.  This seed image must contain an isosurface that you want to use as the
 *    seed for your segmentation.  It can be a binary, graylevel, or floating
 *    point image.  The only requirement is that it contain a closed isosurface
 *    that you will identify as the seed by setting the IsosurfaceValue parameter
 *    of the filter.  For a binary image you will want to set your isosurface
 *    value halfway between your on and off values (i.e. for 0's and 1's, use an
 *    isosurface value of 0.5).
 *
 *    \par
 *    The second input is the feature image.  This is the image from which the
 *    speed function will be calculated.  For most applications, this is the
 *    image that you want to segment. The desired isosurface in your seed image
 *    should lie within the region of your feature image that you are trying to
 *    segment.
 *
 *    Note that this filter does no preprocessing of the feature image before
 *    thresholding.  Because second derivative calculations are highly
 *    sensitive to noise, isotropic or anisotropic smoothing of the feature
 *    image can dramatically improve the results.
 *
 *    \par
 *    See SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter for more information on Inputs.
 *
 *    \par OUTPUTS
 *    The filter outputs a single, scalar, real-valued image.
 *    Positive *values in the output image are inside the segmented region
 *    and negative *values in the image are outside of the inside region.  The
 *    zero crossings of *the image correspond to the position of the level set
 *    front.
 *
 *   \par
 *   See SparseFieldLevelSetImageFilter and
 *   SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter for more information.
 *
 *   \par PARAMETERS
 *   This filter has no parameters other than those described in
 *   SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter.

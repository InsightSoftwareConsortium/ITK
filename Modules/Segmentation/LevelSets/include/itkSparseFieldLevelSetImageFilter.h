/**
 *  \class SparseFieldLevelSetImageFilter
 *
 *  \brief This class implements a finite difference partial differential
 *  equation solver for evolving surfaces embedded in volumes as level-sets.
 *
 *  \par
 *  The "sparse field" approach to the level-set model is a logical extension
 *  of the classical narrow band technique, which seeks to minimize
 *  computational effort by restricting calculations to those pixels in a
 *  region of interest around the moving surface (the \f$k\f$-level curve). The
 *  sparse field method uses a narrow band that is exactly the width needed to
 *  calculate changes on the level curve for the next time step.  Because the
 *  band of grid points under consideration is so sparse, this approach has
 *  several advantages: the algorithm does exactly the number of calculations
 *  needed to determine the next position of the \f$k\f$-level curve, and the
 *  distance transform around the level curve can be recomputed at each
 *  iteration.
 *
 * \par
 *  The sparse field algorithm works by constructing a linked list of indices
 *  that are adjacent to the \f$k\f$-level set.  These indices are called the
 *  "active set".  The values at these active set indices define the
 *  position of the \f$k\f$-level curve.  The active set indices are shifted
 *  to follow the distance transform embedding of the \f$k\f$-level curve as
 *  their values move in and out of a fixed numerical range about \f$k\f$. In
 *  this way, the active set is maintained as only those pixels adjacent to the
 *  evolving surface.  Calculations are then done only at indices contained in
 *  the active set.
 *
 * \par
 *  The city-block neighborhoods of the active set indices are maintained as
 *  separate lists called "layers".  At each iteration, the values at the
 *  layers are reinitialized as the distance transform from the active set.
 *  The number of layers can be adjusted according to the footprint needed for
 *  the calculations on the level curve.
 *
 * \par
 *  Briefly, the sparse field solver algorithm is as follows:
 *
 * \par
 *  1. For each active layer index \f$x_j\f$: Compute the change at
 *  \f$u_{x_j}\f$, the grid point in the embedding, based on local
 *  geometry and external forces and using a stable numerical scheme.
 *
 *  2. For each active layer index \f$x_j\f$, add the change to the grid point
 *  value and redefine the active set indices and those of its layers based on
 *  any value changes which have moved outside of the numerical range allowed
 *  for the active set.
 *
 *  3. Starting with the first layers adjacent to the active set and moving
 *  outwards, reconstruct the distance transform by setting values in the
 *  layers according to their neighbors.  At the very outer layers, add or
 *  remove indices which have come into or moved out of the sparse field.
 *
 * \par HOW TO USE THIS CLASS
 *  Typically, this class should be subclassed with additional functionality
 *  for specific applications.  It is possible, however to use this solver as a
 *  filter directly by instantiating it and supplying it with an appropriate
 *  LevelSetFunction object via the SetDifferenceFunction method.  See the
 *  subclasses and their associated documentation for more information on using
 *  this class.  Also see the FiniteDifferenceImageFilter documentation for a
 *  general overview of this class of solvers.
 *
 * \par INPUTS
 * This filter takes an itk::Image as input.  The appropriate type of input
 * image is entirely determined by the application.  As a rule, however, the
 * input type is immediately converted to the output type before processing.
 * This is because the input is not assumed to be a real value type and must be
 * converted to signed, real values for the calculations.  The input values
 * will also be shifted by the \f$k\f$ isosurface value so that the algorithm
 * only needs to consider the zero level set.
 *
 * \par OUTPUTS
 * The output of the filter is the distance transform embedding of the
 * isosurface as the zero level set.  Values INSIDE the surface will be
 * NEGATIVE and values OUTSIDE the surface will be POSITIVE.  The distance
 * transform only holds for those indices in layers around the active layer.
 * Elsewhere, the values are a fixed positive or negative that is one greater
 * than the layer of greatest magnitude.  In other words, if there are three
 * layers, then inside values reach a minimum of -4.0 and outside values a
 * maximum of 4.0.
 *
 * \par PARAMETERS
 * The NumberOfLayers parameter controls the number of layers inside and
 * outside of the active set (see description above).  The sparse field will
 * contain 2*NumberOfLayers+1 lists of indices: the active set and city block
 * neighbors inside and outside the active set. It is important to
 * specify enough layers to cover the footprint of your calculations.
 * Curvature calculations require a minimum of 2 layers. Higher order
 * derivatives and other geometrical measures may require more layers.
 * If too few layers are specified, then the calculations will pull values
 * from the background, which may consist of arbitrary or random values.
 *
 * \par
 * The IsoSurfaceValue indicates which value in the input represents the
 * interface of interest.  By default, this value is zero.  When the solver
 * initializes, it will subtract the IsoSurfaceValue from all values, in the
 * input, shifting the isosurface of interest to zero in the output.
 *
 * \par IMPORTANT!
 *  Read the documentation for FiniteDifferenceImageFilter before attempting to
 *  use this filter.  The solver requires that you specify a
 *  FiniteDifferenceFunction to use for calculations.  This is set using the
 *  method SetDifferenceFunction in the parent class.

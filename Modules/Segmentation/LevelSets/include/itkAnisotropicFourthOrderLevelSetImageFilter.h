/**
 * \class AnisotropicFourthOrderLevelSetImageFilter
 *
 * \brief This class implements the 4th-order level set anisotropic diffusion
 * (smoothing) PDE.
 *
 * \par INPUT and OUTPUT
 * This is a volume to volume filter; however, it is meant to process (smooth)
 * surfaces. The input surface is an isosurface of the input volume. The
 * isosurface value to be processed can be set by calling SetIsoSurfaceValue
 * (default is 0). The output surface is the 0-isosurface of the output volume,
 * regardless of the input isosurface value. To visualize the input/output
 * surfaces to this filter a mesh extraction method such as marching cubes can
 * be used.
 *
 * \par
 * The 4th-order level set PDE framework is proposed as an alternative to 2nd
 * order PDEs. By order we mean the order of differentiation of the level set
 * image function required to compute derivatives for updating the image. For
 * instance, the popular curvature flow uses 2nd-order derivatives of the level
 * set image; hence, it is a 2nd order PDE.
 *
 * \par
 * 2nd-order curvature flow can be used by itself to smooth surfaces as a
 * post-processing filter or it can be used with other PDE terms such as a
 * Canny edge term that attracts the surface to strong edges in a data
 * image. Curvature flow smoothes surfaces by making the surface move in the
 * direction that will decrease surface area.
 *
 * \par
 * The 4th-order PDE framework provides an improvement over curvature
 * flow. Instead of making the surface move to decrease surface area it makes
 * the surface move to decrease total curvature. Similar to curvature flow,
 * these PDEs can be used alone or in conjunction with data terms. The
 * 4th-order PDE framework is implemented in
 * SparseFieldFourthOrderLevelSetImageFilter. This filter class, which is
 * derived from that, uses the 4th-order PDE by itself to implement an
 * anisotropic surface smoothing algorithm. This is a feature preserving
 * surface processing algorithm that smoothes surfaces but will preserve
 * certain features (creases, edges, other sharp features) depending on the
 * NormalProcessConductanceParameter.
 *
 * \par PARAMETERS
 * As mentioned before, the IsoSurfaceValue parameter chooses which isosurface
 * of the input to process. The MaxFilterIterations parameter determine the
 * number of iterations for which this filter will run. The more iterations,
 * the more smoothing. NormalProcessConductanceParameter controls the amount of
 * feature preservation. Its units are in curvature. Reasonable values for
 * almost all surface are in the range 0.1-0.25 . The shape of the surface
 * where the total curvature is above the value of this parameter will tend to
 * stay the same (be preserved) or even be sharpened. The lower the value, the more
 * feature preservation. Notice the difference between the number of iterations
 * parameter and the conductance parameter: for a given conductance parameter,
 * surface features with high enough curvature will be preserved even if the
 * number of iterations is set to be extremely large.

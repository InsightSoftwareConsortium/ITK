  DOCUMENTATION
  "This module contains classes related to level-set
segmentation.  In level-set segmentation, the segmentation contour is modeled as
the zero level set of a higher dimensional level-set function.  The level-set
function evolves according to a differential equation based on image-based
features and characteristics of the level-set function.  The segmentation
evolves from an initial value for the segmenting contour."

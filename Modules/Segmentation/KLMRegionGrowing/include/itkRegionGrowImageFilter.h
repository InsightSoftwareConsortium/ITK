 *\class RegionGrowImageFilter
 * \brief Base class for RegionGrowImageFilter object
 *
 * itkRegionGrowImageFilter is the base class for the
 * RegionGrowImageFilter objects. It provides
 * the basic function definitions that are inherent to a
 * RegionGrowImageFilter objects.
 * It is templated over the type of input and output image.
 *
 * This object defines the interface for those algorithm that perform
 * feature/object segmentation by merging regions (parts of the image) that
 * are similar in nature based on some metric. As a result parts of the image
 * which belong to the same object gets merged and the region grows.
 *
 * As an example regarding using this class to implementation of advanced
 * region growing algorithm, itkRegionGrowImageFilterKLM class has been
 * derived from this class. The virtual function ApplyRegionGrowImageFilter()
 * provides the interface to the outside world to extend/enhance the scope of
 * the current algorithm or write other region growing algorithms. The
 * function MergeRegions is interface for the operation that merges two
 * regions.
 *
 * The local variable GridSize is used to define
 * the initial small regions that the image is fragmented (atomic
 * regions) into. For an 12 x 12 input image, GridSize set equal
 * to [3, 3] will result in 16 initial regions. The default values are
 * set equal to 2.
 * The user can sets the number of desired regions via the m_MaxNumRegions
 * parameter and the algorithm tries to perform region merging until there
 * are only m_MaxNumRegions. If m_MaxNumRegions is more than the number of
 * initial blocks, no region merging occurs.
 *
 * These blocks are important as the labels associated with these blocks keep
 * changing during the region growing process and at the end, while generating
 * the results, each of these atomic blocks are revisited and the blocks
 * with same labels are considered to belong to the same region.
 *
 * This object supports data handling of multiband images. The object
 * accepts images in vector format, where each pixel is a vector and each
 * element of the vector corresponds to an entry from 1 particular band of
 * a multiband dataset. The input to this object is assumed to be a multiband
 * vector image, and the output is defined by specific algorithm
 * implementation. The second template parameter is used to generate the
 * the output image and can be modified according the algorithm
 * specific output type.
 *
 * We expect the user to provide the input to the routine in vector format.
 * A single band image is treated as a vector image with a single element
 * for every vector.

/** \class LevelSetMotionRegistrationFilter
 * \brief Deformably register two images using level set motion.
 *
 * LevelSetMotionFilter implements a deformable registration algorithm that
 * aligns a fixed and a moving image under level set motion. The
 * equations of motion are similar to those of the
 * DemonsRegistrationFilter. The main differences are:
 *    (1) Gradients of the moving image are calculated on a smoothed
 *    image while intensity difference are measured on the original images
 *    (2) Magnitude of the motion vector is a function of the
 *    differences in intensity between the fixed and moving pixel. An
 *    adaptive timestep is calculated based on the maximum motion
 *    vector over the entire field to ensure stability.  The timestep
 *    also implicitly converts the motion vector measured in units of
 *    intensity to a vector measured in physical units.  Demons, on
 *    the other hand, defines its motion vectors as function of both
 *    the intensity differences and gradient magnitude at each
 *    respective pixel.  Consider two separate pixels with the same
 *    intensity differences between the corresponding fixed and moving
 *    pixel pairs.  In demons, the motion vector of the pixel over a low
 *    gradient region will be larger than the motion vector of the
 *    pixel over a large gradient region. This leads to an unstable
 *    vector field.  In the levelset approach, the motion vectors will
 *    be proportional to the gradients, scaled by the maximum gradient
 *    over the entire field. The pixel with at the lower gradient
 *    position will more less than the pixel at the higher gradient
 *    position.
 *    (3) Gradients are calculated using minmod finite difference
 *    instead of using central differences.
 *
 * A deformation field is represented as a image whose pixel type is some
 * vector type with at least N elements, where N is the dimension of
 * the fixed image. The vector type must support element access via operator
 * []. It is assumed that the vector elements behave like floating point
 * scalars.
 *
 * This class is templated over the fixed image type, moving image type
 * and the deformation field type.
 *
 * The input fixed and moving images are set via methods SetFixedImage
 * and SetMovingImage respectively. An initial deformation field maybe set via
 * SetInitialDisplacementField or SetInput. If no initial field is set,
 * a zero field is used as the initial condition.
 *
 * The algorithm has one parameters: the number of iteration to be performed.
 *
 * The output deformation field can be obtained via methods GetOutput
 * or GetDisplacementField.
 *
 * This class make use of the finite difference solver hierarchy. Update
 * for each iteration is computed in LevelSetMotionFunction.
 *
 * \warning This filter assumes that the fixed image type, moving image type
 * and deformation field type all have the same number of dimensions.

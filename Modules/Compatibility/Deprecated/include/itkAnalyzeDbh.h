                                      Upon loading into the Analyze program, all data is reoriented into the
                                      3D Analyze Coordinate System.
                                      The orientation of patient anatomy in the 3D Analyze Coordinate System
                                      has a fixed orientation relative to each of the orthogonal axes.
                                      This coordinate system does fix the origin in the subject's
                                      Inferior-Right-Posterior location relative to anatomy, with a
                                      left-handed coordinate system for specification of the other
                                      anatomy relative to the axes as given here:
                                      - X-Y plane is Transverse
                                      - X-Z plane is Coronal
                                      - Y-Z plane is Sagittal
where:
- X axis runs from patient right (low X) to patient left (high X)
- Y axis runs from posterior (low Y) to anterior (high Y)
- Z axis runs from inferior (low Z) to superior (high Z)
                                     */

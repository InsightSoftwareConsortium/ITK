/**
 *\class ImageTransformer
 *  \brief Base class for all process objects that transform an image into something else.
 *
 * ImageTransformer is the base class for all process objects that transform an
 * image data. Specifically, this class defines the SetInput() method
 * that takes a pointer to the input image. The class also defines
 * some internal private data members that are used to manage streaming
 * of data.
 *
 * Memory management in an ImageTransformer is slightly different than a
 * standard ProcessObject.  ProcessObject's always release the bulk
 * data associated with their output prior to GenerateData() being
 * called. ImageTransformers default to not releasing the bulk data incase
 * that particular memory block is large enough to hold the new output
 * values.  This avoids unnecessary deallocation/allocation
 * sequences. ImageTransformer's can be forced to use a memory management
 * model similar to the default ProcessObject behaviour by calling
 * ProcessObject::ReleaseDataBeforeUpdateFlagOn().  A user may want to
 * set this flag to limit peak memory usage during a pipeline update.

   * onto the back of input list.  Again, this only makes sense for
   * filters that single type of input.
   *
   * Other uses are also possible. For a single input filter, pushing
   * and popping inputs allow the application to temporarily replace
   * an input to a filter.

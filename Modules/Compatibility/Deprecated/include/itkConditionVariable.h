/**
 *\class ConditionVariable
 * \brief A thread synchronization object used to suspend execution until some
 * condition on shared data is met.
 *
 * A thread calls Wait() to suspend its execution until the condition is
 * met. Each call to Signal() from an executing thread will then cause a single
 * waiting thread to be released.  A call to Signal() means, "signal
 * that the condition is true."  Broadcast() releases all threads waiting on
 * the condition variable.
 *
 * The ITK ConditionVariable implementation is consistent with the standard
 * definition and use of condition variables in pthreads and other common
 * thread libraries.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: A condition variable always requires an associated SimpleMutexLock
 * object.  The mutex object is used to avoid a dangerous race condition when
 * Wait() and Signal() are called simultaneously from two different
 * threads.
 *
 * On systems using pthreads, this implementation abstract the
 * standard calls to the pthread condition variable.  On Win32
 * systems, there is no system provided condition variable.  This
 * class implements a condition variable using a critical section, a
 * semaphore, an event and a number of counters.  The implementation is
 * almost an extract translation of the implementation presented by
 * Douglas C Schmidt and Irfan Pyarali in "Strategies for Implementing
 * POSIX Condition Variables on Win32". This article can be found at
 * http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/win32-cv-1.html

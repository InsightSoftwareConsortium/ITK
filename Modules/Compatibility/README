There is some ambiguity about the need for two separate modules
in the ITK/Modules/Compatibility organization.

All classes and features in ITK/Modules/Compatibility are
considered as Legacy code, and will be removed from the toolkit
in future releases.

Deprecated:  Any code that provides a feature or function
             that is no longer supported in ITKv5

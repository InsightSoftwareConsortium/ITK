ITKReview
=========

Overview
--------

The directory:

  - [Review](../Review)

is exempt from the following policies:

  - Backward Compatibility Policy
  - Copyright Policy

as they are defined by the [Insight Software Consortium (ISC)](https://www.insightsoftwareconsortium.org/).

In practical terms that means that the classes in this directory are not
considered to be a permanent part of the ITK toolkit, and therefore they may
disappear in the future or their API may change without notice.

The copyright of files in this directory may not have been transfered yet to
the [Insight Software Consortium (ISC)](https://www.insightsoftwareconsortium.org/)
and therefore may not be assumed to be under the same BSD-like license of the
rest of the toolkit. During the time that files are in this directory, users
must check their copyright status with ITK developers.

The purpose of this directory is to provide a code review zone for classes
that are candidates to be added to the ITK toolkit.

Files in this directory are not expected to stay here for more than one
release cycle. The classes are expected to mature as a result of discussions
among developers, and when they are ready and their copyright has been
transfered to the ISC, then they should be moved to their permanent directory
in the toolkit.

Some classes may not reach the level required for becoming a permante
component of the ITK toolkit, and as a result will be removed from this
directory.

If you have any questions regarding the status of classes in this directory,
please post a message to the ITK users or the [ITK discussion forum](http://discourse.itk.org).
Please make sure that you mention what exact version of ITK you are using.


  Enjoy ITK !

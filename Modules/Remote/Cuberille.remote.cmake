itk_fetch_module(Cuberille
"This module implements cuberille implicit surface
polygonization for ITK. This method operates by diving the surface into a
number of small cubes called cuberilles. Each cuberille is centered at a
pixel lying on the iso-surface and then quadrilaterals are generated for each
face. The original approach is improved by projecting the vertices of each
cuberille onto the implicit surface, smoothing the typical block-like
resultant mesh.

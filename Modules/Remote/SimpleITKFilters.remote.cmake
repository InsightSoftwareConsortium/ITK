#--
#-- ## Compliance Level 2 star (Alpha code feature API development or niche community/execution environment dependance )
#--   - [X] Compiles for at least 1 niche set of execution envirionments, and perhaps others
#--         (may depend on specific external tools like a java environment, or specific external libraries to work )
#--   - [X] All requirements of Levels 1
#--
#-- ## Compliance Level 1 star (Pre-alpha features under development and code of unknown quality)
#--   - [X] Code complies on at least 1 platform

itk_fetch_module(SimpleITKFilters
  "A Collection of filters designed for SimpleITK.
  The filters in this module may be wrappers of composites ITK
  filters, adapters of existing ITK filters or alternative
  implementations designed for SimpleITK's requirements. Currently it
  contains a discrete hessian, and a composite filter to compute objectness."

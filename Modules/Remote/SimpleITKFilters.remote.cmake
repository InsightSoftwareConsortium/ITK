#--   - [X ] Meets all ITK code style standards
#--   - [X] No external requirements beyond those needed by ITK proper
#--   - [X] Builds and passes tests on all supported platforms within 1 month of each core tagged release
#--            - [ ] Windows Shared Library Build with Visual Studio

#--   - [X] Some tests exist and pass on at least some platform
#--   - [X] All requirements of Levels 2,1
#--
#-- ## Compliance Level 2 star (Alpha code feature API development or niche community/exectution environment dependance )
#--   - [X] Compiles for at least 1 niche set of execution envirionments, and perhaps others
#--         (may depend on specific external tools like a java environment, or specific external libraries to work )
#--   - [X] All requirements of Levels 1
#--
#-- ## Compliance Level 1 star (Pre-alpha features under development and code of unkown quality)
#--   - [X] Code complies on at least 1 platform
#--

#--   - [ ] Code reviewed and explicitly identified as not recommended for use
#--
#-- ### Please document here any justification for the criteria above
#       Code style enforced by clang-format on 2020-02-19, and clang-tidy modernizations completed

itk_fetch_module(SimpleITKFilters
  "A Collection of filters designed for SimpleITK.
  The filters in this module may be wrappers of composites ITK
  filters, adapters of existing ITK filters or alternative
  implementations designed for SimpleITK's requirements. Currently it
  contains a discrete hessian, and a composite filter to compute objectness."

#--   - [ ] Key API features are exposed in wrapping interface
#--   - [ ] All requirements of Levels 4,3,2,1
#--
#-- ## Compliance Level 4 star (Very high-quality code, perhaps small community dependance)
#--   - [ ] Meets all ITK code style standards
#--   - [ ] No external requirements beyond those needed by ITK proper
#--   - [ ] Builds and passes tests on all supported platforms within 1 month of each core tagged release
#--            - [ ] Windows Shared Library Build with Visual Studio
#--            - [ ] Mac with clang compiller
#--            - [ ] Linux with gcc compiler

#-- ## Compliance Level 3 star (Quality beta code)
#--   - [ ] API | executable interface is considered mostly stable and feature complete
#--   - [ ] 10% C0-code coverage demonstrated for testing suite
#--   - [ ] Some tests exist and pass on at least some platform
#--   - [X] All requirements of Levels 2,1
#--
#-- ## Compliance Level 2 star (Alpha code feature API development or niche community/exectution environment dependance )
#--   - [X] Compiles for at least 1 niche set of execution envirionments, and perhaps others
#--         (may depend on specific external tools like a java environment, or specific external libraries to work )
#--   - [X] All requirements of Levels 1
#--
#-- ## Compliance Level 1 star (Pre-alpha features under development and code of unkown quality)
#--   - [X] Code complies on at least 1 platform
#--
#-- ## Compliance Level 0 star ( Code/Feature of known poor-quality or deprecated status )
#--   - [ ] Code reviewed and explicitly identified as not recommended for use
#--
#-- ### Please document here any justification for the criteria above
#       Code style enforced by clang-format on 2020-02-19, and clang-tidy modernizations completed

itk_fetch_module(MultipleImageIterator
"Several applications such as multi-atlas segmentation
require frequent iteration over multiple image volumes at the same time.
Doing so with the regular ITK iterators is tedious and error prone
as it requires updating each iterator at end of each iteration.
Failing to do so results in hard to debug errors and crashes.
The MultipleImageIterator is a simple wrapper class that tries to make this more convenient.

itk_fetch_module(MultipleImageIterator
"Several applications such as multi-atlas segmentation
require frequent iteration over multiple image volumes at the same time.
Doing so with the regular ITK iterators is tedious and error prone
as it requires updating each iterator at end of each iteration.
Failing to do so results in hard to debug errors and crashes.
The MultipleImageIterator is a simple wrapper class that tries to make this more convenient.

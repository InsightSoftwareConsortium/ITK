/**
 * \brief ULTransitionTable
 * The transition table of all the ULEvents, new ULActions, and ULStates.
 *
 * Based roughly on the solutions in player2.cpp in the boost examples and this
 * so question:
 * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1647631/c-state-machine-design
 *
 * The transition table is constructed of TableRows.  Each row is based on an
 * event, and an event handler in the TransitionTable object takes a given
 * event, and then finds the given row.
 *
 * Then, given the current state of the connection, determines the appropriate
 * action to take and then the state to transition to next.

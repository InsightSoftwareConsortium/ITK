/**
 * \brief QueryBase
 * \details contains: the base class for constructing a query dataset for a C-FIND and a
 * C-MOVE
 *
 * There are four levels of C-FIND and C-MOVE query:
 * \li Patient
 * \li Study
 * \li Series
 * \li Image
 *
 * Each one has its own required and optional tags. This class provides an
 * interface for getting those tags. This is an interface class.
 *
 * See 3.4 C 6.1 and 3.4 C 6.2 for the patient and study root query types.
 * These sections define the tags allowed by a particular query. The caller
 * must pass in which root type they want, patient or study. A third root type,
 * Modality Worklist Query, isn't yet supported.
 *
 * This class (or rather it's derived classes) will be held in the RootQuery
 * types. These query types actually make the dataset, and will use this
 * dataset to list the required, unique, and optional tags for each type of
 * query. This design is somewhat overly complicated, but is kept so that if we
 * ever wanted to try to guess the query type from the given tags, we could do
 * so.

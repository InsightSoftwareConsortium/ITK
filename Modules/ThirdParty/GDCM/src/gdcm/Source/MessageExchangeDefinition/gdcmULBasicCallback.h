     * incoming datasets.  DataSets are just concatenated to the mDataSets vector,
     * and the result can be pulled out of the vector by later code.
     * Alternatives to this method include progress updates, saving to disk, etc.
     * This class is NOT THREAD SAFE.  Access the dataset vector after the
     * entire set of datasets has been returned by the ULConnectionManager.

      <section ref="C.7.6.1.1.5" name="">The Attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) conveys that the Image has undergone lossy compression. It provides a means to record that the Image has been compressed (at a point in its lifetime) with a lossy algorithm and changes have been introduced into the pixel data. Once the value has been set to “01”, it shall not be reset.
Note:  If an image is compressed with a lossy algorithm, the attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01”. Subsequently, if the image is decompressed and transferred in uncompressed format, this attribute value remains “01”.

The value of the Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) Attribute in SOP Instances containing multiple frames in which one or more of the frames have undergone lossy compression shall be “01”.
Note:  It is recommended that the applicable frames be noted in the Attribute Derivation Description (0008,2111).

If an image is originally obtained as a lossy compressed image from the sensor, then Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01” and Value 1 of the Attribute Image Type (0008,0008) shall be set to ORIGINAL.
If an image is a compressed version of another image, Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01”, Value 1 of the Attribute Image Type (0008,0008) shall be set to DERIVED, and if the predecessor was a DICOM image, then the Image shall receive a new SOP Instance UID.
Note:  1. It is recommended that the approximate compression ratio be provided in the Attribute Derivation Description (0008,2111). Furthermore, it is recommended that Derivation Description (0008,2111) be used to indicate when pixel data changes might affect professional interpretation. (see C.7.6.1.1.3).
  2. The attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is defined as Type 3 for backward compatibility with existing IODs. It is expected to be required (i.e., defined as Type 1C) for new Image IODs and for existing IODs that undergo a major revision (e.g. a new IOD is specified).
The Defined Terms for Lossy Image Compression Method (0028,2114) are:
ISO_10918_1 = JPEG Lossy Compression
ISO_14495_1 = JPEG-LS Near-lossless Compression

Note:   Specimen Accession Number (0040,050A) identifies tissue or fluid obtained from a Patient in a Specimen-harvest procedure. This Attribute was created to differentiate Accession Numbers, as used in Anatomic Pathology to identify specimens, from other uses of the term “Accession Number” in Information Systems. The Specimen Accession Number (0040,050A) is typically unique within the scope of the institution in which the Accession is performed. An Accession may contain multiple Specimens. Typically, an Accession contains the Specimens obtained in one Specimen-harvest procedure and submitted by one Requesting Physician. However, multiple Specimen-harvest procedures may be involved.

Note:   The Specimen Identifier (0040,0551) is typically unique within the scope of the institution in which the related Accession is performed. However, a value of Specimen Identifier (0040,0551) does not always exist. For example, it is common practice in some Anatomic Pathology departments to use a Specimen Identifier (0040,0551) to identify specimen-containers or blocks only if multiple containers or blocks are submitted for a single Accession. Therefore, Specimen Identifier (0040,0551) is modeled as a Type 2 Attribute.

Notes:  1. Previous versions of this Standard defined a Data Element "Location", which has been retired. Frame of Reference UID provides a completely unambiguous identification of the image location reference used to indicate position.
  2. A common Frame of Reference UID may be used to spatially relate localizer images with a set of transverse images. However, in some cases (eg. multiple localizer images being related to a single set of transverse images) a common Frame of Reference UID may not be sufficient. The Referenced Image Sequence (0008,1140) provides an unambiguous method for relating localizer images.

All SOP Instances that share the same Synchronization Frame of Reference UID shall be temporally related to each other.

The UTC Synchronization UID, 1.2.840.10008.15.1.1, may be used when the equipment is synchronized to the international standard UTC. In this case the quality of synchronization may be determined by means of the Time Distribution Protocol (0018,1802) and NTP Source Address (0018,1803).
Notes:  1. The Synchronization Frame of Reference UID defines an equipment synchronization environment, and does not need to be changed for each unrelated acquisition. SOP Instances may therefore share a Synchronization Frame of Reference UID, but be clinically unrelated (e.g., apply to different patients).
  2. When a synchronization environment is recalibrated, a new UID must be issued.
  3. The method of distributing the Synchronization Frame of Reference UID to multiple devices is not specified.

      <section ref="C.7.4.2.1.4" name="">The Acquisition Time Synchronized (0018,1800) attribute specifies whether the Acquisition DateTime (0008,002A) attribute of the Waveform Identification Module or the General Image Module represents an accurate synchronized timestamp for the acquisition of the waveform and/or image data. For triggered multi-frame images, the Acquisition DateTime applies to the trigger for the first image frame (see attribute Image Trigger Delay (0018.1067) in the Cine Module).
Note:   The degree of precision of the Acquisition DateTime and its accuracy relative to the external clock are not specified, but need to be appropriate for the clinical application.

For IODs that include the SR Document Content Module, the Acquisition Time Synchronized (0018,1800) attribute specifies whether the Observation DateTime (0040,A032) attribute of Items in the Content Sequence (0040,A730) of the SR Document Content Module represents an accurate synchronized timestamp for the Item.

      <description>Single pixel value or one limit (inclusive) of a range of pixel values used in animage to pad to rectangular format or to signal background that may be suppressed. See C.7.5.1.1.2 for further explanation.
Required if Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121) is present. May be present otherwise.
Note: The Value Representation of this Attribute is determined by the value of Pixel Representation (0028,0103).</description>
      <section ref="C.7.5.1.1.2" name="">Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) is used to pad grayscale images (those with a Photometric Interpretation of MONOCHROME1 or MONOCHROME2)to rectangular format. The native format of some images is not rectangular. It is common for devices with this format to pad the images to the rectangular format required by the DICOM Standard with a specific pixel value that is not contained in the native image. Further, when resampling, such as after spatial registration, padding may need to be used to fill previously non-existent pixels.
Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121) are also used to identify pixels to be excluded from the normal grayscale rendering pipeline for other reasons, such as suppression of background air. Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121) is defined in the Image Pixel Module.
Notes:  1. The “native image” is that which is being padded to the required rectangular format, e.g., the area within the circular reconstruction perimeter of a CT image, or the subset of the rectangular area that contains useful image information.
  2. The pixel padding value is explicitly described in order to prevent display applications from taking it into account when determining the dynamic range of an image, since the Pixel Padding Value will be outside the range between the minimum and maximum values of the pixels in the native image
  3. No pixels in the native image will have a value equal to Pixel Padding Value.

Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) specifies either a single value of this padding value, or when combined with Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121), a range of values (inclusive) that are padding.
The values of Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121) shall be valid values within the constraints defined by Bits Allocated (0028,0100), Bits Stored (0028,0101), and High Bit (0028,0102).
Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121) shall not be present when padding is performed but the pixel value used for padding does occur in the native image.
If Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME2, Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) shall be less than (closer to or equal to the minimum possible pixel value) or equal to Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121). If Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME1, Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) shall be greater than (closer to or equal to the maximum possible pixel value) or equal to Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121).
Notes:  1. When the relationship between pixel value and X-Ray Intensity is unknown, it is recommended that the following values be used to pad with black when the image is unsigned:
  0 if Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME2.
  2BitsStored - 1 if Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME1.
  and when the image is signed:
    -2BitsStored-1 if Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME2.
  2BitsStored-1 - 1 if Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME1.
  2. For projection radiography, when the relationship between pixel value and X-Ray Intensity is known (for example as defined by Pixel Intensity Relationship (0028,1040) and Pixel Intensity relationship Sign (0028,1041)), it is recommended that a pixel value equivalent to, or rendered similarly to, air (least X-Ray absorbance) be used for padding. However, if such a value may occur in the native image, the Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) Attribute itself should not be sent.
  E.g., for an XRF image obtained with an image intensifier, if air is black then a padded perimeter, if any, should also appear black. Typically though, if unpadded, this area would be collimated with a circular collimator, in which case the pixels would appear natively as white (greatest X-Ray absorbance) and a circular shutter would be necessary to neutralize them as black. Whether collimated areas are detected and treated as padded, or neutralized with shutters is at the discretion of the application. See also the Display Shutter Module C.7.6.11.
  3. The conditional requirement for the Pixel Padding Value Range Limit (0028,0121) in the Image Pixel Module means that it shall not be present unless Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) is also present.
  4. The range of values to be suppressed between Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Value Range Limit (0028,0121) is specified as being inclusive, that is the values themselves as well as all values between are suppressed.
  5. When Pixel Padding Value Range Limit (0028,0121) is present, but not supported by a rendering application, the constraint that Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) is closest to the “blackest” value, which is typically the most frequently occurring background pixel, will most often result in an acceptable display, permitting “backward compatibility” in the majority of cases.

When modifying equipment changes the pixel padding value in the image, it shall change the values of Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121), if present. If modifying equipment changes the pixel padding values in the image to values present in the native image, the attribute Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121) shall be removed.
Notes:  1. For example, if a CT image containing signed values from -1024 to 3191 and a Pixel Padding Value of -2000 and a Rescale Intercept of 0 is converted to an unsigned image with a Rescale Intercept of -1024 by adding 1024 to all pixels and clipping all more negative pixels to 0, then the padding pixels will be indistinguishable from some of the modified native image pixels, and hence Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) needs to be removed.
  2. If the modification involves lossy compression, which may result in changes to the pixel values, then the application of Pixel Padding Value and Pixel Padding Range Limit may result in a different appearance, and hence these attributes may need different values also.

REORIENTED_ONLY - A projection radiograph that has been flipped, and/or rotated by a multiple of 90 degrees

Notes: 1. This applies not only to images with a known relationship to a 3D space, but also to projection images. For example, a projection radiograph such as a mammogram that is processed by a point image processing operation such as contrast enhancement, or a smoothing or edge enhancing convolution, would have a value of YES for this attribute. A projection radiograph that had been magnified or warped geometrically would have a value of NO for this attribute. A projection radiograph that has been flipped, and/or rotated by a multiple of 90 degrees, such that transformation of pixel locations is possible by comparison of the values of Patient Orientation (0020,0020) would have a value of REORIENTED_ONLY. This attribute is typically of importance in relating images with Presentation Intent Type (0008,0068) values of FOR PROCESSING and FOR PRESENTATION.
2. When the value of this attribute is NO, it is not possible to locate on the current image any pixel coordinates that are referenced relative to the source image, such as for example, might be required for rendering CAD findings derived from a referenced FOR PROCESSING image on the current FOR PRESENTATION image.</description>

Required if pixel padding is to be defined as a range rather than a single value.
Notes: 1. The Value Representation of this Attribute is determined by the value of Pixel Representation (0028,0103).
2. Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) is also required when this Attribute is present.</description>
      <section ref="C.7.5.1.1.2" name="">Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) is used to pad grayscale images (those with a Photometric Interpretation of MONOCHROME1 or MONOCHROME2)to rectangular format. The native format of some images is not rectangular. It is common for devices with this format to pad the images to the rectangular format required by the DICOM Standard with a specific pixel value that is not contained in the native image. Further, when resampling, such as after spatial registration, padding may need to be used to fill previously non-existent pixels.
Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121) are also used to identify pixels to be excluded from the normal grayscale rendering pipeline for other reasons, such as suppression of background air. Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121) is defined in the Image Pixel Module.
Notes:  1. The “native image” is that which is being padded to the required rectangular format, e.g., the area within the circular reconstruction perimeter of a CT image, or the subset of the rectangular area that contains useful image information.
  2. The pixel padding value is explicitly described in order to prevent display applications from taking it into account when determining the dynamic range of an image, since the Pixel Padding Value will be outside the range between the minimum and maximum values of the pixels in the native image
  3. No pixels in the native image will have a value equal to Pixel Padding Value.

Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) specifies either a single value of this padding value, or when combined with Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121), a range of values (inclusive) that are padding.
The values of Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121) shall be valid values within the constraints defined by Bits Allocated (0028,0100), Bits Stored (0028,0101), and High Bit (0028,0102).
Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121) shall not be present when padding is performed but the pixel value used for padding does occur in the native image.
If Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME2, Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) shall be less than (closer to or equal to the minimum possible pixel value) or equal to Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121). If Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME1, Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) shall be greater than (closer to or equal to the maximum possible pixel value) or equal to Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121).
Notes:  1. When the relationship between pixel value and X-Ray Intensity is unknown, it is recommended that the following values be used to pad with black when the image is unsigned:
  0 if Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME2.
  2BitsStored - 1 if Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME1.
  and when the image is signed:
    -2BitsStored-1 if Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME2.
  2BitsStored-1 - 1 if Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME1.
  2. For projection radiography, when the relationship between pixel value and X-Ray Intensity is known (for example as defined by Pixel Intensity Relationship (0028,1040) and Pixel Intensity relationship Sign (0028,1041)), it is recommended that a pixel value equivalent to, or rendered similarly to, air (least X-Ray absorbance) be used for padding. However, if such a value may occur in the native image, the Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) Attribute itself should not be sent.
  E.g., for an XRF image obtained with an image intensifier, if air is black then a padded perimeter, if any, should also appear black. Typically though, if unpadded, this area would be collimated with a circular collimator, in which case the pixels would appear natively as white (greatest X-Ray absorbance) and a circular shutter would be necessary to neutralize them as black. Whether collimated areas are detected and treated as padded, or neutralized with shutters is at the discretion of the application. See also the Display Shutter Module C.7.6.11.
  3. The conditional requirement for the Pixel Padding Value Range Limit (0028,0121) in the Image Pixel Module means that it shall not be present unless Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) is also present.
  4. The range of values to be suppressed between Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Value Range Limit (0028,0121) is specified as being inclusive, that is the values themselves as well as all values between are suppressed.
  5. When Pixel Padding Value Range Limit (0028,0121) is present, but not supported by a rendering application, the constraint that Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) is closest to the “blackest” value, which is typically the most frequently occurring background pixel, will most often result in an acceptable display, permitting “backward compatibility” in the majority of cases.

When modifying equipment changes the pixel padding value in the image, it shall change the values of Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121), if present. If modifying equipment changes the pixel padding values in the image to values present in the native image, the attribute Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121) shall be removed.
Notes:  1. For example, if a CT image containing signed values from -1024 to 3191 and a Pixel Padding Value of -2000 and a Rescale Intercept of 0 is converted to an unsigned image with a Rescale Intercept of -1024 by adding 1024 to all pixels and clipping all more negative pixels to 0, then the padding pixels will be indistinguishable from some of the modified native image pixels, and hence Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) needs to be removed.
  2. If the modification involves lossy compression, which may result in changes to the pixel values, then the application of Pixel Padding Value and Pixel Padding Range Limit may result in a different appearance, and hence these attributes may need different values also.

      <description>Number of samples (planes) in this image. See C.7.6.3.1.1 for further explanation.</description>
      <section ref="C.7.6.3.1.1" name="">Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) is the number of separate planes in this image. One, three, and four image planes are defined. Other numbers of image planes are allowed, but their meaning is not defined by this Standard.
For monochrome (gray scale) and palette color images, the number of planes is 1. For RGB and other three vector color models, the value of this attribute is 3. For four vector color models, the value of this attribute is 4.
All image planes shall have the same number of Rows (0028,0010), Columns (0028,0011), Bits Allocated (0028,0100), Bits Stored (0028,0101), High Bit (0028,0102), Pixel Representation (0028,0103), and Pixel Aspect Ratio (0028,0034).
The data in each pixel may be represented as a “Composite Pixel Code”. If Samples Per Pixel is one, the Composite Pixel Code is just the “n” bit pixel sample, where “n” = Bits Allocated. If Samples Per Pixel is greater than one, Composite Pixel Code is a “k” bit concatenation of samples, where “k” = Bits Allocated multiplied by Samples Per Pixel, and with the sample representing the vector color designated first in the Photometric Interpretation name comprising the most significant bits of the Composite Pixel Code, followed in order by the samples representing the next vector colors, with the sample representing the vector color designated last in the Photometric Interpretation name comprising the least significant bits of the Composite Pixel Code. For example, for Photometric Interpretation = “RGB”, the most significant “Bits Allocated” bits contain the Red sample, the next “Bits Allocated” bits contain the Green sample, and the least significant “Bits Allocated” bits contain the Blue sample.

      <description>Specifies the intended interpretation of the pixel data. See C.7.6.3.1.2 for further explanation.</description>
      <section ref="C.7.6.3.1.2" name="">The value of Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) specifies the intended interpretation of the image pixel data.
See PS 3.5 for restrictions imposed by compressed Transfer Syntaxes.
The following values are defined. Other values are permitted but the meaning is not defined by this Standard.
MONOCHROME1 = Pixel data represent a single monochrome image plane. The minimum sample value is intended to be displayed as white after any VOI gray scale transformations have been performed. See PS 3.4. This value may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 1.
MONOCHROME2 = Pixel data represent a single monochrome image plane. The minimum sample value is intended to be displayed as black after any VOI gray scale transformations have been performed. See PS 3.4. This value may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 1.
PALETTE COLOR = Pixel data describe a color image with a single sample per pixel (single image plane). The pixel value is used as an index into each of the Red, Blue, and Green Palette Color Lookup Tables (0028,1101-1103&amp;1201-1203). This value may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 1. When the Photometric Interpretation is Palette Color; Red, Blue, and Green Palette Color Lookup Tables shall be present.
RGB = Pixel data represent a color image described by red, green, and blue image planes. The minimum sample value for each color plane represents minimum intensity of the color. This value may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 3.
HSV = Retired.
ARGB = Retired.
CMYK = Retired.
YBR_FULL = Pixel data represent a color image described by one luminance (Y) and two chrominance planes (CB and CR). This photometric interpretation may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 3. Black is represented by Y equal to zero. The absence of color is represented by both CB and CR values equal to half full scale.
Note:  In the case where the Bits Allocated (0028,0100) has value of 8 half full scale is 128.

In the case where Bits Allocated (0028,0100) has a value of 8 then the following equations convert between RGB and YCBCR Photometric Interpretation.
Y =  +  .2990R  +  .5870G  +  .1140B
CB =  -  .1687R  -  .3313G  +  .5000B  +  128
CR =  +  .5000R  -  .4187G  -  .0813B  +  128
Note:  The above is based on CCIR Recommendation 601-2 dated 1990.

YBR_FULL_422 = The same as YBR_FULL except that the CB and CR values are sampled horizontally at half the Y rate and as a result there are half as many CB and CR values as Y values.
This Photometric Interpretation is only allowed with Planar Configuration (0028,0006) equal to 0. Two Y values shall be stored followed by one CB and one CR value. The CB and CR values shall be sampled at the location of the first of the two Y values. For each Row of Pixels, the first CB and CR samples shall be at the location of the first Y sample. The next CB and CR samples shall be at the location of the third Y sample etc.
Note:  This subsampling is often referred to as cosited sampling.

YBR_PARTIAL_422 = The same as YBR_FULL_422 except that:
1. black corresponds to Y = 16;
2. Y is restricted to 220 levels (i.e. the maximum value is 235);
3. CB and CR each has a minimum value of 16;
4. CB and CR are restricted to 225 levels (i.e. the maximum value is 240);
5. lack of color is represented by CB and CR equal to 128.
In the case where Bits Allocated (0028,0100) has value of 8 then the following equations convert between RGB and YBR_PARTIAL_422 Photometric Interpretation
Y =  +  .2568R  +  .5041G  +  .0979B  +  16
CB =  -  .1482R  -  .2910G  +  .4392B  +  128
CR =  +  .4392R  -  .3678G  -  .0714B  +  128
Note:  The above is based on CCIR Recommendation 601-2 dated 1990.

YBR_PARTIAL_420 = The same as YBR_PARTIAL_422 except that the CB and CR values are sampled horizontally and vertically at half the Y rate and as a result there are four times less CB and CR values than Y values, versus twice less for YBR_PARTIAL_422.
This Photometric Interpretation is only allowed with Planar Configuration (0028,0006) equal to 0. The CB and CR values shall be sampled at the location of the first of the two Y values. For the first Row of Pixels (etc.), the first CB and CR samples shall be at the location of the first Y sample. The next CB and CR samples shall be at the location of the third Y sample etc. The next Rows of Pixels containing CB and CR samples (at the same locations than for the first Row) will be the third etc.
YBR_ICT = Irreversible Color Transformation:
Pixel data represent a color image described by one luminance (Y) and two chrominance planes (CB and CR). This photometric interpretation may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 3. Black is represented by Y equal to zero. The absence of color is represented by both CB and CR values equal to zero.
Regardless of the value of Bits Allocated (0028,0100), the following equations convert between RGB and YCBCR Photometric Interpretation.
Y =  +  .29900R  +  .58700G  +  .11400B
CB =  -  .16875R  -  .33126G  +  .50000B
CR =  +  .50000R  -  .41869G  -  .08131B
Notes:  1. The above is based on ISO/IEC 15444-1 (JPEG 2000).
  2. In a JPEG 2000 bitstream, DC level shifting (used if the untransformed components are unsigned) is applied before forward color transformation, and the transformed components may be signed (unlike in JPEG ISO/IEC 10918-1).
  3. In JPEG 2000, spatial down-sampling of the chrominance components, if performed, is signaled in the JPEG 2000 bitstream.

YBR_RCT = Reversible Color Transformation:
Pixel data represent a color image described by one luminance (Y) and two chrominance planes (CB and CR). This photometric interpretation may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 3. Black is represented by Y equal to zero. The absence of color is represented by both CB and CR values equal to zero.
Regardless of the value of Bits Allocated (0028,0100), the following equations convert between RGB and YBR_RCT Photometric Interpretation.
Y = R + 2G +B) / 4        (Note:  mean floor)
CB = B - G
CR = R - G
The following equations convert between YBR_RCT and RGB Photometric Interpretation.
G = Y –  (CR + CB) / 4
R = CR + G
B = CB + G
Notes:  1. The above is based on ISO/IEC 15444-1 (JPEG 2000).
  2. In a JPEG 2000 bitstream, DC level shifting (used if the untransformed components are unsigned) is applied before forward color transformation, and the transformed components may be signed (unlike in JPEG ISO/IEC 10918-1).
  3. This photometric interpretation is a reversible approximation to the YUV transformation used in PAL and SECAM.

Enumerated Values:

      <section ref="C.7.6.3.1.5" name="">The three values of Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptor (0028,1101-1103) describe the format of the Lookup Table Data in the corresponding Data Element (0028,1201-1203) or (0028,1221-1223).
The first value is the number of entries in the lookup table. When the number of table entries is equal to 216 then this value shall be 0. The first value shall be identical for each of the Red, Green and Blue Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptors.
The second value is the first stored pixel value mapped. This pixel value is mapped to the first entry in the Lookup Table Data. All image pixel values less than the first value mapped are also mapped to the first entry in the Lookup Table Data if the Photometric Interpretation is PALETTE COLOR.
Note:  In the case of the Supplemental Palette Color LUT, the stored pixel values less than the second descriptor value are grayscale values.

An image pixel value one greater than the first value mapped is mapped to the second entry in the Lookup Table Data. Subsequent image pixel values are mapped to the subsequent entries in the Lookup Table Data up to an image pixel value equal to number of entries + first value mapped – 1, which is mapped to the last entry in the Lookup Table Data. Image pixel values greater than or equal to number of entries + first value mapped are also mapped to the last entry in the Lookup Table Data. The second value shall be identical for each of the Red, Green and Blue Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptors.
The third value specifies the number of bits for each entry in the Lookup Table Data. It shall take the value of 8 or 16. The LUT Data shall be stored in a format equivalent to 8 bits allocated when the number of bits for each entry is 8, and 16 bits allocated when the number of bits for each entry is 16, where in both cases the high bit is equal to bits allocated-1. The third value shall be identical for each of the Red, Green and Blue Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptors.
Note:  Some implementations have encoded 8 bit entries with 16 bits allocated, padding the high bits; this can be detected by comparing the number of entries specified in the LUT Descriptor with the actual value length of the LUT Data entry. The value length in bytes should equal the number of entries if bits allocated is 8, and be twice as long if bits allocated is 16.

When the Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptor (0028,1101-1103) are used as part of the Palette Color Lookup Table Module or the Supplemental Palette Color Lookup Table Module, the third value shall be equal to 16.
Notes:  1. A value of 16 indicates the Lookup Table Data will range from (0,0,0) minimum intensity to (65535,65535,65535) maximum intensity.
  2. Since the Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptor (0028,1101-1103) Attributes are multi-valued, in an Explicit VR Transfer Syntax, only one value representation (US or SS) may be specified, even though the first and third values are always by definition interpreted as unsigned. The explicit VR actually used is dictated by the VR needed to represent the second value, which will be consistent with Pixel Representation (0028,0103).

Palette color values must always be scaled across the full range of available intensities. This is indicated by the fact that there are no bits stored and high bit values for palette color data.
Note:  For example, if there are 16 bits per entry specified and only 8 bits of value are truly used then the 8 bit intensities from 0 to 255 must be scaled to the corresponding 16 bit intensities from 0 to 65535. To do this for 8 bit values, simply replicate the value in both the most and least significant bytes.

These lookup tables shall be used only when there is a single sample per pixel (single image plane) in the image.
These lookup tables are required when the value of Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is Palette Color. The semantics of these lookup tables is not defined otherwise.

Palette color values must always be scaled across the full range of available intensities. This is indicated by the fact that there are no bits stored and high bit values for palette color data.
Note:  For example, if there are 16 bits per entry specified and only 8 bits of value are truly used then the 8 bit intensities from 0 to 255 must be scaled to the corresponding 16 bit intensities from 0 to 65535. To do this for 8 bit values, simply replicate the value in both the most and least significant bytes.

These lookup tables shall be used only when there is a single sample per pixel (single image plane) in the image.
These lookup tables are required when the value of Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is Palette Color. The semantics of these lookup tables is not defined otherwise.

      <section ref="C.7.6.16.2.14.1" name="">Subtraction Item ID (0028,9416) specifies the ID of a subtraction operation to which the Mask Sub-pixel Shift (0028,6114) is associated. The Subtraction Item ID is also present in the Mask Subtraction Sequence (0028,6100) to allow this association.
When used as per-frame macro, the Subtraction Item ID (0028,9416) allows to specify different values of Mask Sub-pixel Shift (0028,6114) individually frame by frame, and relate them to a single item of the Mask Subtraction Sequence (0028,6100).
Note:  There is no restriction in the number of Subtraction Item ID’s associated to each contrast frame. The same contrast frame may be present in several items of the Mask Subtraction Sequence, each item having a different value of Subtraction Item ID.

When used as shared macro, the Subtraction Item ID (0028,9416) allows to specify one or more values of Mask Sub-pixel Shift that will be applied to all the frames of the Multi-frame image.
Note:  Example of usage of Subtraction Item ID in a per-frame macro, see Figure C.7.6.16-8:
  In this example of Multi-Frame Image with 3 frames, one Mask Frame (i.e., Frame 1) is applied to the next two frames of the Multi-Frame image (i.e., Frames 2 and 3). Therefore, there is only one item in the Mask Subtraction Sequence, containing its own Subtraction Item ID value (i.e., 100). The Frame Pixel Shift Macro allows to define a Mask Sub-Pixel Shift different for each contrast frame.
  First Frame Subtracted: Subtraction of Frame 1 (Mask) to Frame 2, with Sub-Pixel Shift 1.3\2.4
  Second Frame Subtracted: Subtraction of Frame 1 (Mask) to Frame 3, with Sub-Pixel Shift 1.9\3.0

The direction of the axes is defined fully by the patient’s orientation. The x-axis is increasing to the left hand side of the patient. The y-axis is increasing to the posterior side of the patient. The z-axis is increasing toward the head of the patient.
The patient based coordinate system is a right handed system, i.e. the vector cross product of a unit vector along the positive x-axis and a unit vector along the positive y-axis is equal to a unit vector along the positive z-axis.
Note  If a patient lies parallel to the ground, face-up on the table, with his feet-to-head direction same as the front-to-back direction of the imaging equipment, the direction of the axes of this patient based coordinate system and the equipment based coordinate system in previous versions of this Standard will coincide.

The Image Plane Attributes, in conjunction with the Pixel Spacing Attribute, describe the position and orientation of the image slices relative to the patient-based coordinate system. In each image frame the Image Position (Patient) (0020,0032) specifies the origin of the image with respect to the patient-based coordinate system. RCS and the Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037) attribute values specify the orientation of the image frame rows and columns. The mapping of pixel location  to the RCS is calculated as follows:

They may be used whether or not the Source Image Sequence (0008,2112) is provided. They may also be used in cases when the Derived Image pixel data is not significantly changed from one of the source images and the SOP Instance UID of the Derived Image is the same as the one used for the source image.
Notes:  1. Examples of Derived Images that would normally be expected to affect professional interpretation and would thus have a new UID include:
  a.  images resulting from image processing of another image (e.g. unsharp masking),
  b.  a multiplanar reformatted CT image,
  c.  a DSA image derived by subtracting pixel values of one image from another.
d.  an image that has been decompressed after having been compressed with a lossy compression algorithm. To ensure that the user has the necessary information about the lossy compression, the approximate compression ratio may be included in Derivation Description (0008,2111).
  An example of a Derived Image that would normally not be expected to affect professional interpretation and thus would not require a new UID is an image that has been padded with additional rows and columns for more display purposes.
  2. An image may be lossy compressed, e.g., for long term archive purposes, and its SOP Instance UID changed. PS3.4 provides a mechanism by which a query for the original image Instance may return a reference to the UID of the lossy compressed version of the image using the Alternate Representation Sequence (0008,3001). This allows an application processing a SOP Instance that references the original image UID, e.g., a Structured Report, to obtain a reference to an accessible version of the image even if the original SOP Instance is no longer available.

Notes:  1. Examples of Derived Images that would normally be expected to affect professional interpretation and would thus have a new UID include:
  a.  images resulting from image processing of another image (e.g. unsharp masking),
  b.  a multiplanar reformatted CT image,
  c.  a DSA image derived by subtracting pixel values of one image from another.
d.  an image that has been decompressed after having been compressed with a lossy compression algorithm. To ensure that the user has the necessary information about the lossy compression, the approximate compression ratio may be included in Derivation Description (0008,2111).
  An example of a Derived Image that would normally not be expected to affect professional interpretation and thus would not require a new UID is an image that has been padded with additional rows and columns for more display purposes.

      <description>Window Center for display. See C.11.2.1.2 for further explanation.</description>
      <section ref="C.11.2.1.2" name="">Window Center (0028,1050) and Window Width (0028,1051) specify a linear conversion from stored pixel values (after any Modality LUT or Rescale Slope and Intercept specified in the IOD have been applied) to values to be displayed. Window Center contains the input value that is the center of the window. Window Width contains the width of the window.
Note:  The terms “window center” and “window width” are not consistently used in practice, nor were they defined in previous versions of the standard. The definitions here are presented for the purpose of defining consistent meanings for identity and threshold transformations while preserving the common practice of using integral values for center and width.

Window Width (0028,1051) shall always be greater than or equal to 1.
When Window Width (0028,1051) is greater than 1, these Attributes select the range of input values that are to be mapped to the full range of the displayed output.
When Window Width (0028,1051) is equal to 1, they specify a threshold below which input values will be displayed as the minimum output value.
Note:  Whether the minimum output value is rendered as black or white may depend on the value of Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) or the presence of a Presentation LUT Module.

These Attributes are applied according to the following pseudo-code, where x is the input value, y is an output value with a range from ymin to ymax, c is Window Center (0028,1050) and w is Window Width (0028,1051):
    if  (x &lt;= c - 0.5 - (w-1)/2), then y = ymin
    else if  (x &gt; c - 0.5 + (w-1)/2), then y = ymax,
    else  y = ((x - (c - 0.5)) / (w-1) + 0.5) * (ymax - ymin)+ ymin

Notes:  1. For the purpose of this definition, a floating point calculation without integer truncation is assumed, though the manner of implementation may vary as long as the result is the same.
  2. The pseudo-code function computes a continuous value over the output range without any discontinuity at the boundaries. The value of 0 for w is expressly forbidden, and the value of 1 for w does not cause division by zero, since the continuous segment of the function will never be reached for that case.
  3. For example, for an output range 0 to 255:
    c=2048, w=4096 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= 0) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; 4095) then y = 255
      else y = ((x - 2047.5) / 4095 + 0.5) * (255-0) + 0
    c=2048, w=1 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= 2047.5) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; 2047.5) then y = 255
      else /* not reached */

    c=0, w=100 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= -50) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; 49) then y = 255
      else y = ((x + 0.5) / 99 + 0.5) * (255-0) + 0
    c=0, w=1 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= -0.5) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; -0.5) then y = 255
      else /* not reached */

  4. A Window Center of 2n-1 and a Window Width of 2n selects the range of input values from 0 to 2n-1. This represents an identity VOI LUT transformation in the case where no Modality LUT is specified and the stored pixel data are n bit unsigned integers.
  5. A Window Width of 1 is typically used to represent a "threshold" operation in which those integer input values less than the Window Center are represented as the minimum displayed value and those greater than or equal to the Window Center are represented as the maximum displayed value. A Window Width of 2 will have the same result for integral input values.
  6. The application of Window Center (0028,1050) and Window Width (0028,1051) may select a signed input range. There is no implication that this signed input range is clipped to zero.
  7. The selected input range may exceed the actual range of the input values, thus effectively “compressing” the contrast range of the displayed data into a narrower band of the available contrast range, and “flattening” the appearance. There are no limits to the maximum value of the window width, or to the minimum or maximum value of window level, both of which may exceed the actual or possible range of input values.
  8. Input values "below" the window are displayed as the minimum output value and input values "above" the window are displayed as the maximum output value. This is the common usage of the window operation in medical imaging. There is no provision for an alternative approach in which all values "outside" the window are displayed as the minimum output value.
  9. The output of the Window Center/Width or VOI LUT transformation is either implicitly scaled to the full range of the display device if there is no succeeding transformation defined, or implicitly scaled to the full input range of the succeeding transformation step (such as the Presentation LUT), if present. See C.11.6.1.
  10. Fractional values of Window Center and Window Width are permitted (since the VR of these Attributes is Decimal String), and though they are not often encountered, applications should be prepared to accept them.

These Attributes shall be used only for Images with Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) values of MONOCHROME1 and MONOCHROME2. They have no meaning for other Images.
If multiple values are present, both Attributes shall have the same number of values and shall be considered as pairs. Multiple values indicate that multiple alternative views may be presented.
If any VOI LUT Table is included by an Image, a Window Width and Window Center or the VOI LUT Table, but not both, may be applied to the Image for display. Inclusion of both indicates that multiple alternative views may be presented.
If multiple items are present in VOI LUT Sequence (0028,3010), only one may be applied to the Image for display. Multiple items indicate that multiple alternative views may be presented.
If the VOI LUT Module is defined in an IOD and if neither a VOI LUT Sequence nor a Window Width and Window Center are present, then the VOI LUT stage of the grayscale pipeline is defined to be an identity transformation.
Notes:  1. This requirement is specified so that IODs that define a particular output space for the grayscale pipeline, such as P-Values, are not in an undefined state when no VOI LUT Sequence or Window Width and Window Center are present.
  2. Despite the Type 3 requirement for VOI LUT Sequence and Window Center, implementations that render images are expected to implement and apply these transformations when they are present in the image, unless overridden by the user, a presentation state, or a hanging protocol, and to allow the user to select which transformation to apply when multiple transformations are present.

If multiple items are present in VOI LUT Sequence (0028,3010), only one may be applied to the Image for display. Multiple items indicate that multiple alternative views may be presented.
If the VOI LUT Module is defined in an IOD and if neither a VOI LUT Sequence nor a Window Width and Window Center are present, then the VOI LUT stage of the grayscale pipeline is defined to be an identity transformation.
Notes:  1. This requirement is specified so that IODs that define a particular output space for the grayscale pipeline, such as P-Values, are not in an undefined state when no VOI LUT Sequence or Window Width and Window Center are present.
  2. Despite the Type 3 requirement for VOI LUT Sequence and Window Center, implementations that render images are expected to implement and apply these transformations when they are present in the image, unless overridden by the user, a presentation state, or a hanging protocol, and to allow the user to select which transformation to apply when multiple transformations are present.

When used as per-frame macro, the Subtraction Item ID (0028,9416) allows to specify different values of Mask Sub-pixel Shift (0028,6114) individually frame by frame, and relate them to a single item of the Mask Subtraction Sequence (0028,6100).
Note:  There is no restriction in the number of Subtraction Item ID’s associated to each contrast frame. The same contrast frame may be present in several items of the Mask Subtraction Sequence, each item having a different value of Subtraction Item ID.

When used as shared macro, the Subtraction Item ID (0028,9416) allows to specify one or more values of Mask Sub-pixel Shift that will be applied to all the frames of the Multi-frame image.
Note:  Example of usage of Subtraction Item ID in a per-frame macro, see Figure C.7.6.16-8:
  In this example of Multi-Frame Image with 3 frames, one Mask Frame (i.e., Frame 1) is applied to the next two frames of the Multi-Frame image (i.e., Frames 2 and 3). Therefore, there is only one item in the Mask Subtraction Sequence, containing its own Subtraction Item ID value (i.e., 100). The Frame Pixel Shift Macro allows to define a Mask Sub-Pixel Shift different for each contrast frame.
  First Frame Subtracted: Subtraction of Frame 1 (Mask) to Frame 2, with Sub-Pixel Shift 1.3\2.4
  Second Frame Subtracted: Subtraction of Frame 1 (Mask) to Frame 3, with Sub-Pixel Shift 1.9\3.0

However, when frames are the result of retrospective gating, that is, the data is continuously acquired and then later compared with a simultaneously acquired respiratory waveform and fitted into bins corresponding to nominal phases of the respiratory cycle, then Nominal Respiratory Trigger Delay Time (0020,9255) and the Actual Respiratory Trigger Delay Time (0020,9257) may have different values.

      <description>Specifies the format of the Red Palette Color Lookup Table Data (0028,1201). See C.7.6.3.1.5 for further explanation.</description>
      <section ref="C.7.6.3.1.5" name="">The three values of Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptor (0028,1101-1103) describe the format of the Lookup Table Data in the corresponding Data Element (0028,1201-1203) or (0028,1221-1223).
The first value is the number of entries in the lookup table. When the number of table entries is equal to 216 then this value shall be 0. The first value shall be identical for each of the Red, Green and Blue Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptors.
The second value is the first stored pixel value mapped. This pixel value is mapped to the first entry in the Lookup Table Data. All image pixel values less than the first value mapped are also mapped to the first entry in the Lookup Table Data if the Photometric Interpretation is PALETTE COLOR.
Note:  In the case of the Supplemental Palette Color LUT, the stored pixel values less than the second descriptor value are grayscale values.

An image pixel value one greater than the first value mapped is mapped to the second entry in the Lookup Table Data. Subsequent image pixel values are mapped to the subsequent entries in the Lookup Table Data up to an image pixel value equal to number of entries + first value mapped – 1, which is mapped to the last entry in the Lookup Table Data. Image pixel values greater than or equal to number of entries + first value mapped are also mapped to the last entry in the Lookup Table Data. The second value shall be identical for each of the Red, Green and Blue Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptors.
The third value specifies the number of bits for each entry in the Lookup Table Data. It shall take the value of 8 or 16. The LUT Data shall be stored in a format equivalent to 8 bits allocated when the number of bits for each entry is 8, and 16 bits allocated when the number of bits for each entry is 16, where in both cases the high bit is equal to bits allocated-1. The third value shall be identical for each of the Red, Green and Blue Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptors.
Note:  Some implementations have encoded 8 bit entries with 16 bits allocated, padding the high bits; this can be detected by comparing the number of entries specified in the LUT Descriptor with the actual value length of the LUT Data entry. The value length in bytes should equal the number of entries if bits allocated is 8, and be twice as long if bits allocated is 16.

When the Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptor (0028,1101-1103) are used as part of the Palette Color Lookup Table Module or the Supplemental Palette Color Lookup Table Module, the third value shall be equal to 16.
Notes:  1. A value of 16 indicates the Lookup Table Data will range from (0,0,0) minimum intensity to (65535,65535,65535) maximum intensity.
  2. Since the Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptor (0028,1101-1103) Attributes are multi-valued, in an Explicit VR Transfer Syntax, only one value representation (US or SS) may be specified, even though the first and third values are always by definition interpreted as unsigned. The explicit VR actually used is dictated by the VR needed to represent the second value, which will be consistent with Pixel Representation (0028,0103).

Note:  In the case of the Supplemental Palette Color LUT, the stored pixel values less than the second descriptor value are grayscale values.

An image pixel value one greater than the first value mapped is mapped to the second entry in the Lookup Table Data. Subsequent image pixel values are mapped to the subsequent entries in the Lookup Table Data up to an image pixel value equal to number of entries + first value mapped – 1, which is mapped to the last entry in the Lookup Table Data. Image pixel values greater than or equal to number of entries + first value mapped are also mapped to the last entry in the Lookup Table Data. The second value shall be identical for each of the Red, Green and Blue Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptors.
The third value specifies the number of bits for each entry in the Lookup Table Data. It shall take the value of 8 or 16. The LUT Data shall be stored in a format equivalent to 8 bits allocated when the number of bits for each entry is 8, and 16 bits allocated when the number of bits for each entry is 16, where in both cases the high bit is equal to bits allocated-1. The third value shall be identical for each of the Red, Green and Blue Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptors.
Note:  Some implementations have encoded 8 bit entries with 16 bits allocated, padding the high bits; this can be detected by comparing the number of entries specified in the LUT Descriptor with the actual value length of the LUT Data entry. The value length in bytes should equal the number of entries if bits allocated is 8, and be twice as long if bits allocated is 16.

When the Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptor (0028,1101-1103) are used as part of the Palette Color Lookup Table Module or the Supplemental Palette Color Lookup Table Module, the third value shall be equal to 16.
Notes:  1. A value of 16 indicates the Lookup Table Data will range from (0,0,0) minimum intensity to (65535,65535,65535) maximum intensity.
  2. Since the Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptor (0028,1101-1103) Attributes are multi-valued, in an Explicit VR Transfer Syntax, only one value representation (US or SS) may be specified, even though the first and third values are always by definition interpreted as unsigned. The explicit VR actually used is dictated by the VR needed to represent the second value, which will be consistent with Pixel Representation (0028,0103).

Once the value has been set to “01”, it shall not be reset.
Note:  If an image is compressed with a lossy algorithm, the attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01”. Subsequently, if the image is decompressed and transferred in uncompressed format, this attribute value remains “01”.

The value of the Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) Attribute in SOP Instances containing multiple frames in which one or more of the frames have undergone lossy compression shall be “01”.
Note:  It is recommended that the applicable frames be noted in the Attribute Derivation Description (0008,2111).

If an image is a compressed version of another image, Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01”, Value 1 of the Attribute Image Type (0008,0008) shall be set to DERIVED, and if the predecessor was a DICOM image, then the Image shall receive a new SOP Instance UID.
Note:  1. It is recommended that the approximate compression ratio be provided in the Attribute Derivation Description (0008,2111). Furthermore, it is recommended that Derivation Description (0008,2111) be used to indicate when pixel data changes might affect professional interpretation. (see C.7.6.1.1.3).
  2. The attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is defined as Type 3 for backward compatibility with existing IODs. It is expected to be required (i.e., defined as Type 1C) for new Image IODs and for existing IODs that undergo a major revision (e.g. a new IOD is specified).

      <section ref="C.7.6.2.1.1" name="">The Image Position (0020,0032) specifies the x, y, and z coordinates of the upper left hand corner of the image; it is the center of the first voxel transmitted. Image Orientation (0020,0037) specifies the direction cosines of the first row and the first column with respect to the patient. These Attributes shall be provide as a pair. Row value for the x, y, and z axes respectively followed by the Column value for the x, y, and z axes respectively.
The direction of the axes is defined fully by the patient’s orientation. The x-axis is increasing to the left hand side of the patient. The y-axis is increasing to the posterior side of the patient. The z-axis is increasing toward the head of the patient.
The patient based coordinate system is a right handed system, i.e. the vector cross product of a unit vector along the positive x-axis and a unit vector along the positive y-axis is equal to a unit vector along the positive z-axis.
Note  If a patient lies parallel to the ground, face-up on the table, with his feet-to-head direction same as the front-to-back direction of the imaging equipment, the direction of the axes of this patient based coordinate system and the equipment based coordinate system in previous versions of this Standard will coincide.

The Image Plane Attributes, in conjunction with the Pixel Spacing Attribute, describe the position and orientation of the image slices relative to the patient-based coordinate system. In each image frame the Image Position (Patient) (0020,0032) specifies the origin of the image with respect to the patient-based coordinate system. RCS and the Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037) attribute values specify the orientation of the image frame rows and columns. The mapping of pixel location  to the RCS is calculated as follows:

Sxyz  The three values of the Image Position (Patient) (0020,0032) attributes. It is the location in mm from the origin of the RCS.
Xxyz  The values from the row (X) direction cosine of the Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037) attribute.

      <description>The x, y, and z coordinates of the upper left hand corner (center of the first voxel transmitted) of the image, in mm. See C.7.6.2.1.1 for further explanation.</description>
      <section ref="C.7.6.2.1.1" name="">The Image Position (0020,0032) specifies the x, y, and z coordinates of the upper left hand corner of the image; it is the center of the first voxel transmitted. Image Orientation (0020,0037) specifies the direction cosines of the first row and the first column with respect to the patient. These Attributes shall be provide as a pair. Row value for the x, y, and z axes respectively followed by the Column value for the x, y, and z axes respectively.
The direction of the axes is defined fully by the patient’s orientation. The x-axis is increasing to the left hand side of the patient. The y-axis is increasing to the posterior side of the patient. The z-axis is increasing toward the head of the patient.
The patient based coordinate system is a right handed system, i.e. the vector cross product of a unit vector along the positive x-axis and a unit vector along the positive y-axis is equal to a unit vector along the positive z-axis.
Note  If a patient lies parallel to the ground, face-up on the table, with his feet-to-head direction same as the front-to-back direction of the imaging equipment, the direction of the axes of this patient based coordinate system and the equipment based coordinate system in previous versions of this Standard will coincide.

The Image Plane Attributes, in conjunction with the Pixel Spacing Attribute, describe the position and orientation of the image slices relative to the patient-based coordinate system. In each image frame the Image Position (Patient) (0020,0032) specifies the origin of the image with respect to the patient-based coordinate system. RCS and the Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037) attribute values specify the orientation of the image frame rows and columns. The mapping of pixel location  to the RCS is calculated as follows:

P rSub { size 8{y} }  {} ##
P rSub { size 8{z} }  {} ##

Where:
Pxyz  The coordinates of the voxel (i,j) in the frame’s image plane in units of mm.
Sxyz  The three values of the Image Position (Patient) (0020,0032) attributes. It is the location in mm from the origin of the RCS.
Xxyz  The values from the row (X) direction cosine of the Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037) attribute.
Yxyz  The values from the column (Y) direction cosine of the Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037) attribute.
i    Column index to the image plane. The first column is index zero.
i  Column pixel resolution of the Pixel Spacing (0028,0030) attribute in units of mm.
j    Row index to the image plane. The first row index is zero.
j  Row pixel resolution of the Pixel Spacing (0028,0030) attribute in units of mm.

Additional constraints apply:
1)  The row and column direction cosine vectors shall be orthogonal, i.e. their dot product shall be zero.
2)  The row and column direction cosine vectors shall be normal, i.e. the dot product of each direction cosine vector with itself shall be unity.

      <section ref="C.8.5.5.1.3" name="">Region Flags (0018,6016) specify characteristics of US Regions.
Bit 0 of the Region Flags specifies the relative priority of the pixel component calibration specified by an US Region in the case where the US Region intersects with other US Regions. The calibration supplied by one or more of the regions may not be valid in the area that they intersect. Enumerated Values for Bit 0 (lsb):
  1 = Region pixels are low priority
  0 = Region pixels are high priority
A high priority region overwrites data of a low priority region when they overlap, thus invalidating any pixel component calibration specified for a low priority region. pixel component calibration of overlapping regions of the same priority is indeterminate where they overlap. Figure C.8-6 shows an example of intersecting regions.


Figure C.8-6
 Intersecting Spatial Format Regions and Overlapping Measurement
In this example, Region B is Color Flow while Region A is Tissue Echo. If Region B Color Flow values share the same bit planes as Region A Tissue Echo values, then it is indeterminate whether a pixel in this region is a Color Flow pixel or a Tissue Echo pixel. Since the pixels of the Color Flow region overwrite those of the Tissue Echo region, the Region Flag of the Tissue Echo region is assigned low priority and the Region Flag of the color region is assigned high priority. This means that if both the Tissue Echo and Color Flow regions define pixel component calibration that only the calibration specified by the Color Flow region can be applied to the pixel data value at Point X.
The measurement in Figure C.8-6 is a line between Point Y and Point Z. Both points are in Region A so the distance between them can be calculated using the Region A scaling (assuming that Region A defines both the Physical Units X Direction and Y Direction as being cm). If the points are in Region B, and hence also in Region A, it is still possible to calculate the distance because the region scaling is identical in both regions. The lower priority of Region B only applies to its pixel component calibration, not its X and Y direction scaling.
Enumerated Values for Bit 1 Scaling Protection:
  1 = Protected
  0 = Not Protected
Ultrasound systems should set this to 1 if the image is scaled automatically by the ultrasound system. If the image is frame-grabbed and scaling is not available then it should be set to 0. If the region is protected, the region can not be manually rescaled. That is the data defined by the region calibration Module can not be overridden by a reader of that image.

An example of Component Calibration for an ultrasound image is shown in Figure C.8-8.

Pixel Component Calibration Example
In this example, some pixels lie within two Regions. One Region specifies pixel component calibration for Doppler velocity values. The second Region specifies pixel component calibration for Doppler magnitude. A particular Pixel Data (7FE0,0010) value will thus map to a displayed value, a Doppler velocity and magnitude value.
The example has a Palette Color Photometric Interpretation with 16 Bits Allocated and Bits Stored per sample. The Palette Color Lookup Tables also have 16 bits for each entry. The fact that the example has just one sample per pixel means that each composite pixel value is identical to the single Pixel Data value. An example Pixel Data value is shown in brackets along with the output values resulting from each step where it is processed.
The Pixel Data value is mapped to red, green, and blue values from the supplied Palette Color Lookup Tables before being displayed. The display device supports 8 bits per sample and thus requires the scaling of the output values from the 16 bit per entry LUTs.
The Doppler Velocity Region maps each pixel value in the Region to the Doppler velocity. The Pixel Component Organization (0018,6044) has a value of zero, indicating bit aligned positions with a bit mask. The Pixel Component Mask (0018,6046) specifies that the least significant 4 bits of the most significant byte convey the Doppler velocity of each pixel. The Pixel Component Physical Units (0018,604C) are cm/sec, and the Pixel Component Data Type (0018,604E) indicates color flow velocity. The Table of X Break Points (0018,6052) and Table of Y Break Points (0018,6054) map each masked composite pixel value to a Doppler velocity value in cm/sec.
The Doppler Magnitude Region maps each pixel value in the Region to the Doppler magnitude. The Pixel Component Organization (0018,6044) has a value of zero, indicating bit aligned positions with a bit mask. The Pixel Component Mask (0018,6046) specifies that the most significant 4 bits of the most significant byte convey the Doppler magnitude of each pixel. The Pixel Component Physical Units (0018,604C) is set to dB, and the Pixel Component Data Type (0018,604E) indicates color flow magnitude. The Table of X Break Points (0018,6052) and Table of Y Break Points (0018,6054) map each masked composite pixel value to a Doppler magnitude value in dB.

      <section ref="C.7.6.1.1.5" name="">The Attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) conveys that the Image has undergone lossy compression. It provides a means to record that the Image has been compressed (at a point in its lifetime) with a lossy algorithm and changes have been introduced into the pixel data. Once the value has been set to “01”, it shall not be reset.
Note:  If an image is compressed with a lossy algorithm, the attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01”. Subsequently, if the image is decompressed and transferred in uncompressed format, this attribute value remains “01”.

The value of the Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) Attribute in SOP Instances containing multiple frames in which one or more of the frames have undergone lossy compression shall be “01”.
Note:  It is recommended that the applicable frames be noted in the Attribute Derivation Description (0008,2111).

If an image is originally obtained as a lossy compressed image from the sensor, then Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01” and Value 1 of the Attribute Image Type (0008,0008) shall be set to ORIGINAL.
If an image is a compressed version of another image, Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01”, Value 1 of the Attribute Image Type (0008,0008) shall be set to DERIVED, and if the predecessor was a DICOM image, then the Image shall receive a new SOP Instance UID.
Note:  1. It is recommended that the approximate compression ratio be provided in the Attribute Derivation Description (0008,2111). Furthermore, it is recommended that Derivation Description (0008,2111) be used to indicate when pixel data changes might affect professional interpretation. (see C.7.6.1.1.3).
  2. The attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is defined as Type 3 for backward compatibility with existing IODs. It is expected to be required (i.e., defined as Type 1C) for new Image IODs and for existing IODs that undergo a major revision (e.g. a new IOD is specified).

  2. The attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is defined as Type 3 for backward compatibility with existing IODs. It is expected to be required (i.e., defined as Type 1C) for new Image IODs and for existing IODs that undergo a major revision (e.g. a new IOD is specified).
The Defined Terms for Lossy Image Compression Method (0028,2114) are:
ISO_10918_1 = JPEG Lossy Compression
ISO_14495_1 = JPEG-LS Near-lossless Compression
ISO_15444_1 = JPEG 2000 Irreversible Compression
ISO_13818_2 = MPEG2 Compression

This is intended for SOP Instances whose preferred clinical presentation is dependent on frame relationships other than simply time.
Defined Terms for multiframe cine from the Cine Module (see C.7.6.5) are:

Defined Terms for an arbitrary labeled increment:

Notes:  1. Previous editions of the standard did not include the optional Frame Dimension Pointer (0028,000A), but instead depended entirely on the mandatory Frame Increment Pointer (0028,0009), and envisaged that only time and no other dimension would relate frames. Image creators that add the Frame Dimension Pointer (0028,000A) must anticipate that many implementations will ignore or discard this attribute when displaying or storing images and continue to assume that frames are temporally related.
  2. Frame Time (0018,1063) or Frame Time Vector (0018,1065) will also be present and will contain appropriate values consistent with the times of acquisition of the frames.

      <section ref="C.8.11.3.1.2" name="">Pixel Intensity Relationship (0028,1040) and Pixel Intensity Relationship Sign (0028,1041) describe how the stored pixel values in Pixel Data (7FE0,0010) are related to the X-Ray beam intensity incident on the detector.
They do not define a transformation intended to be applied to the pixel data for presentation.
Note:  For example, if Pixel Intensity Relationship (0028,1040) is LIN and Pixel Intensity Relationship Sign (0028,1041) is -1, then lower values of Pixel Data (7FE0,0010) indicate higher X-Ray beam intensities corresponding to less radiographically dense regions projected on the image such as through air, and higher values of Pixel Data (7FE0,0010) indicate lower X-Ray beam intensities corresponding to more radiographically dense regions projected on the image such as through bone and radio-opaque contrast agents.

The transformation to be applied to the pixel data for presentation is defined by the successive application of the conceptual Modality LUT, the VOI Attributes and the conceptual Presentation LUT. This shall result in the output of P-Values.
Rescale Slope (0028,1053) and Rescale Intercept (0028,1052) define a linear subset of a conceptual Modality LUT transformation. For IODs that include this Module, these Attributes define an identity transformation. IODs that include the DX Image Module shall not include the Modality LUT Module.
The Presentation LUT Shape (2050,0020) defines a subset of a conceptual Presentation LUT. For IODs that include this Module, this Attribute defines an identity transformation or inverse identity transformation. IODs that include the DX Image Module shall not include the Presentation LUT Module.
Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) indicates whether lower values that are the output of the VOI Attributes should be displayed as darker or lighter. Since the output of the equivalent of a conceptual Presentation LUT is in P-Values, which are defined in PS 3.14 such that lower values correspond to lower luminance levels, then the definition of the Presentation LUT Shape (2050,0020), otherwise intended to be an identity transformation, must take into account the effect of the value specified for Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004).
Note:  Regardless of the values of Pixel Intensity Relationship (0028,1040) and Pixel Intensity Relationship Sign (0028,1041), the grayscale transformations to be applied to the Pixel Data (7FE0,0010) are defined by the equivalent of the Modality LUT (Rescale Slope (0028,1053) and Rescale Intercept (0028,1052)), Value of Interest Attributes, Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) and the equivalent of the Presentation LUT (Presentation LUT Shape (2050,0020)). However, the combination of the grayscale transformations and the description of the pixel intensity relationship, together define whether, for example, air is expected to be displayed as black or white.

If Grid Frame Offset Vector (3004,000C) is present and its first element is zero, this attribute contains an array of n elements indicating the plane location of the data in the right-handed image coordinate system, relative to the position of the first dose plane transmitted, i.e., the point at which the Image Position (Patient) (0020,0032) attribute is defined, with positive offsets in the direction of the cross product of the row and column directions.
b.  If Grid Frame Offset Vector (3004,000C) is present, its first element is equal to the third element of Image Position (Patient) (0020,0032), and Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037) has the value (1,0,0,0,1,0), then Grid Frame Offset Vector contains an array of n elements indicating the plane location (patient z coordinate) of the data in the patient coordinate system.

In future implementations, use of option a) is strongly recommended.
This attribute is conditional since the RT Dose module may be included even if pixel doses are not being transmitted, or the image may be a single-frame image. If the Multi-frame Module is present, Frame Increment Pointer (0028,0009) shall have the Enumerated Value of 3004000C (Grid Frame Offset Vector).
Note:  Option (a) can represent a rectangular-parallelepiped dose grid with any orientation with respect to the patient, while option (b) can only represent a rectangular-parallelepiped dose grid whose planes are in the transverse patient dimension and whose x- and y-axes are parallel to the patient x- and y-axes.
  Example: Figure C.8.8.3-1 shows an example of plane positions for a dose grid with transverse planes.



Figure C.8.8.3-1 Dose Grid Frame Example
  For this example, Table C.8.39b gives the values of elements in the Grid Frame Offset Vector (3004,000C) for both relative (option (a)) and absolute (option (b)) interpretations, under the following conditions:
  1. The value of Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037) is (1,0,0,0,1,0). I.e., the dose grid is transverse with x- and y-axes parallel to the patient x- and y-axes;
  2. The value of Image Position (Patient) (0020,0032), i.e. the position of the first element of the dose grid, is (4, 5, 6); and
  3. The spacing between adjacent dose grid planes is 2mm (uniform).

Note also that if Final Cumulative Meterset Weight (300A,010E) is equal to 100, then Cumulative Meterset Weight (300A,0134) becomes equivalent to the percentage of Beam Meterset (300A,0086) delivered at each control point.

The Cumulative Dose Reference Coefficient (300A,010C) is by definition zero for the initial control point. The Cumulative Dose Reference Coefficient (300A,010C) of the final control point multiplied by Brachy Application Setup Dose (300A,00A4) results in the final dose to the referenced dose reference site for the current channel.

      <section ref="C.8.9.1.1.4" name="">The Series Type (0054,1000), Value 1 is used to identify the spatial location and temporal nature of the images within a PET Series. The Enumerated Values and their definitions are:
  STATIC = a group of images at varying spatial locations at the same time
  DYNAMIC = a group of images at a set of spatial locations (e.g. slices) at varying time slices, with all spatial locations acquired at all time slices
  GATED = a group of images at the same spatial location, same starting and ending time, but acquired in different time slots of (possibly) different R-R intervals
  WHOLE BODY = same as STATIC, except covering multiple transverse fields of view (and therefore acquired at a different time).
Notes:  1. Using this definition and the comments in C.8.9.1.1.1, here are some examples of PET series and the encoding of Series Type (0054,1000) Value 1.
  Static acquisition: a group of n transverse images at varying superior&lt;-&gt;inferior locations, all acquired between the same starting and ending time. Series Type = STATIC.
  Dynamic acquisition: a group of n*m transverse images at n superior&lt;-&gt;inferior locations, acquired with m different starting and ending times. Series Type = DYNAMIC.
  Gated acquisition: a group of n*m*p transverse images at n superior&lt;-&gt;inferior locations, all acquired between the same starting and ending time, acquired in m different R-R Intervals (as determined by Low R-R Value (0018,1081) and High R-R Value (0018,1082)), and acquired in p time slots of a given R-R Interval (as determined by Trigger Time (0054,1000) ). Series Type = GATED.
  Whole body acquisition: a group of n transverse images at varying superior&lt;-&gt;inferior locations covering a significant fraction of the entire body. Series Type = WHOLE BODY.
  Multiple transverse fields of view: a group of n transverse images at varying superior&lt;-&gt;inferior locations. Series Type = WHOLE BODY.
  Interleaved: group of 2*n transverse images acquired at overlapped AFOVs to increase transverse sampling. Series Type = WHOLE BODY.
  Sagittal (Coronal, Oblique): sagittal (coronal, oblique) re-sliced images derived by reformatting transverse images. The Series Type is STATIC, DYNAMIC, GATED, or WHOLE BODY depending on source Series Type.
  Arithmetic: images derived by an arithmetic operation on operand images. The Series Type is STATIC, DYNAMIC, GATED, or WHOLE BODY depending on source Series Type.
  Metabolic: images derived by a metabolic model. The Series Type is STATIC, DYNAMIC, GATED, or WHOLE BODY depending on source Series Type.

  2. Using this definition, here are some images that are not stored in the same PET Series:
  Two images from the same scan that were reconstructed differently.
  Emission and transmission images for the same Patient and Study, even if acquired simultaneously (because emission and transmission images have different reconstruction processing).
  Two images of same patient, one after NH3 injection and one after FDG injection.
  Two images: an original image created from reconstructed scan data and its derived image based on a metabolic model.

The Series Type (0054,1000), Value 2 is used to identify the volumetric meaning of the images within a PET Series. The Enumerated Values and their definitions are:
  IMAGE = a tomographic image slice
  REPROJECTION = a projection image derived from forward projection through slices of tomographic images, using the algorithm defined in Reprojection Method (0054,1004).

      <section ref="C.7.6.1.1.5" name="">The Attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) conveys that the Image has undergone lossy compression. It provides a means to record that the Image has been compressed (at a point in its lifetime) with a lossy algorithm and changes have been introduced into the pixel data. Once the value has been set to “01”, it shall not be reset.
Note:  If an image is compressed with a lossy algorithm, the attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01”. Subsequently, if the image is decompressed and transferred in uncompressed format, this attribute value remains “01”.

The value of the Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) Attribute in SOP Instances containing multiple frames in which one or more of the frames have undergone lossy compression shall be “01”.
Note:  It is recommended that the applicable frames be noted in the Attribute Derivation Description (0008,2111).

If an image is originally obtained as a lossy compressed image from the sensor, then Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01” and Value 1 of the Attribute Image Type (0008,0008) shall be set to ORIGINAL.
If an image is a compressed version of another image, Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01”, Value 1 of the Attribute Image Type (0008,0008) shall be set to DERIVED, and if the predecessor was a DICOM image, then the Image shall receive a new SOP Instance UID.
Note:  1. It is recommended that the approximate compression ratio be provided in the Attribute Derivation Description (0008,2111). Furthermore, it is recommended that Derivation Description (0008,2111) be used to indicate when pixel data changes might affect professional interpretation. (see C.7.6.1.1.3).
  2. The attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is defined as Type 3 for backward compatibility with existing IODs. It is expected to be required (i.e., defined as Type 1C) for new Image IODs and for existing IODs that undergo a major revision (e.g. a new IOD is specified).
The Defined Terms for Lossy Image Compression Method (0028,2114) are:
ISO_10918_1 = JPEG Lossy Compression
ISO_14495_1 = JPEG-LS Near-lossless Compression
ISO_15444_1 = JPEG 2000 Irreversible Compression
ISO_13818_2 = MPEG2 Compression

Note:  The scheme for encoding Image Index (0054,1330) is as follows. Images within a PET Series can be viewed as a multi-dimensional array whose possible dimensions include R-R Intervals, Time Slots, Time Slices, and Slices. The dimensions of the array are defined by the Series Type (0054,1000) Value 1. Each dimension of the array has an index that identifies the position of this image in the array. The indices are: R-R Interval Index, Time Slot Index, Time Slice Index, Slice Index. The indices are calculated as follows:

      <section ref="C.8.11.1.1.1" name="">Presentation Intent Type (0008,0068) shall identify the intent for the purposes of display or other presentation of all Images within this Series.
Notes:  1. Since this is a Series level attribute, all Images within a Series have the same value for this Attribute.
  2. The intent of this restriction is to ensure that FOR PRESENTATION and FOR PROCESSING images are placed in separate Series, so that no confusion can arise as to which images are suitable for diagnostic reading as determined by local policy.

A Series of Images intended for viewing by an observer, after application of any grayscale transformations specified in the image object such as VOI LUT, shall have an Enumerated Value of FOR PRESENTATION.
Notes:  1. These images may still be of Image Type (0008,0008) ORIGINAL rather than DERIVED despite the possibility that they may have undergone some processing, such as unsharp masking. In this case a DERIVED image would have undergone yet further processing to make it substantially different from the original. See Figure C.8-13.
  2. These images may still be subjected to processing or further processing, if appropriate, depending on the application.
  3. These images are intended for display on a device, without (further) processing, since that device may not be capable of image processing. The quality of the displayed image or its suitability for any purpose is beyond the scope of the DICOM Standard.

Images that have been corrected to account for characteristics of the detector but which are intended to be further processed before being displayed, shall have an Enumerated Value of FOR PROCESSING.
Note:  This type is provided to allow the functions of image acquisition and image processing for presentation to be separated and yet have images conveyed between the two processes using a DICOM object. Individual sites or users may choose to substitute their own specialized processing in place of that supplied by the implementor.
  Images available at this stage of processing may be useful for quality control and problem solving purposes, as well as academic research.
  Images of this type may also be archived, retrieved and processed with different algorithms or parameters in order to alter the appearance of specific features for clinical purposes.
  The nature of the detector correction that may have been applied before sending an image of type FOR PROCESSING is not specified. In particular, acquisitions that acquire several sets of matrices of pixel values (such as image data, gain offset and a defect map) must perform some processing (detector correction) before a DX Image object can be instantiated.
  The nature of the processing that may have been applied before sending an image of type FOR PRESENTATION is also not specified.
  It is expected that individual implementors will use Private Attributes to convey specifics of the processing applied that may be of use for further processing by those aware of the parameters and algorithms. The diversity of detector types and processing algorithms make it undesirable to standardize such parameters.
  Whether or not the spatial locations of all pixels are preserved during the processing of the source image that resulted in the current image can be indicated by Spatial Locations Preserved (0028,135A) in a Source Image Sequence (0008,2112) reference from the FOR PRESENTATION image to a FOR PROCESSING predecessor.

If images from the same exposure exist with different Values of Presentation Intent Type (0008,0068), then they shall have different SOP Instance UIDs.

They do not define a transformation intended to be applied to the pixel data for presentation.
Note:  For example, if Pixel Intensity Relationship (0028,1040) is LIN and Pixel Intensity Relationship Sign (0028,1041) is -1, then lower values of Pixel Data (7FE0,0010) indicate higher X-Ray beam intensities corresponding to less radiographically dense regions projected on the image such as through air, and higher values of Pixel Data (7FE0,0010) indicate lower X-Ray beam intensities corresponding to more radiographically dense regions projected on the image such as through bone and radio-opaque contrast agents.

The transformation to be applied to the pixel data for presentation is defined by the successive application of the conceptual Modality LUT, the VOI Attributes and the conceptual Presentation LUT. This shall result in the output of P-Values.

Since the output of the equivalent of a conceptual Presentation LUT is in P-Values, which are defined in PS 3.14 such that lower values correspond to lower luminance levels, then the definition of the Presentation LUT Shape (2050,0020), otherwise intended to be an identity transformation, must take into account the effect of the value specified for Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004).

Note:  If the Presentation LUT Shape (2050,0020) is IDENTITY, then the result of applying the Window Center (0028,1050) and Window Width (0028,1051) is P-Values.

If multiple values are present, both Attributes shall have the same number of values and shall be considered as pairs. Multiple values indicate that multiple alternative views should be presented.

Note:  Some of these Attributes relate the image data to manufacturer specific characteristics of the detector that may be used for quality control purposes, e.g. correlation of image artifacts with a detector defect map, analysis of noise performance, etc.

The Displayed Area is defined in pixel coordinates relative to the stored image pixel values by the Attributes of the Display Shutter Module (see section C.7.6.11). If this Module is not present or supported, then the Displayed Area is equal to the Field of View.
The Exposed Area is defined in pixel coordinates relative to the stored image pixel values by the Attributes of the X-Ray Collimator Module (see section C.8.7.3).
For the Digital X-Ray IODs, the Field of View is usually rectangular in shape and the same size as the stored Pixel Data (7FE0,0010). The shape and size of the Field of View and the spacing of the pixels are defined by the following Attributes:
- Field of View Shape (0018,1147),
- Field of View Dimensions (0018,1149),
- Imager Pixel Spacing (0018,1164),
- Rows (0028,0010),
- Columns (0028,0011)

The following Attributes define the relationship of the Field of View to the Physical Detector Area:
- Field of View Origin (0018,7030),
- Field of View Rotation (0018,7032),
- Field of View Horizontal Flip (0018,7034).

For the Digital X-Ray IODs, the Active Area, i.e. that part of the detector matrix that was activated for this exposure, is usually rectangular in shape. The shape and size of the Active Area and the size and spacing of the detectors are defined by the following Attributes:
- Detector Active Shape (0018,7024),
- Detector Active Dimensions (0018,7026),
- Detector Element Physical Size (0018,7020),
- Detector Element Spacing (0018,7022).

Notes:  1. The Detector Element Physical Size (0018,7020) and Detector Element Spacing (0018,7022) may be different if there are insensitive regions between each detector.
  2. This model of description is not able to accurately describe multiple matrices of detectors that are “tiled” to produce a single image.

The following optional Attribute defines the relationship of the Active Area to the Physical Detector Area:
- Detector Active Origin (0018,7028).

The relationship between detectors and stored image pixels is defined by Detector Binning (0018,701A) which specifies how many detectors, in each of the row and column directions, contribute to (are pooled or averaged to form) a single stored image pixel.
Note:  Detector Binning (0018,701A) may have values less than one if sub-sampling is used to derive an image with higher spatial resolution than the detector matrix.

Note:  Some of these Attributes relate the image data to manufacturer specific characteristics of the detector that may be used for quality control purposes, e.g. correlation of image artifacts with a detector defect map, analysis of noise performance, etc.

The Displayed Area is defined in pixel coordinates relative to the stored image pixel values by the Attributes of the Display Shutter Module (see section C.7.6.11). If this Module is not present or supported, then the Displayed Area is equal to the Field of View.
The Exposed Area is defined in pixel coordinates relative to the stored image pixel values by the Attributes of the X-Ray Collimator Module (see section C.8.7.3).
For the Digital X-Ray IODs, the Field of View is usually rectangular in shape and the same size as the stored Pixel Data (7FE0,0010). The shape and size of the Field of View and the spacing of the pixels are defined by the following Attributes:
- Field of View Shape (0018,1147),
- Field of View Dimensions (0018,1149),
- Imager Pixel Spacing (0018,1164),
- Rows (0028,0010),
- Columns (0028,0011)

The following Attributes define the relationship of the Field of View to the Physical Detector Area:
- Field of View Origin (0018,7030),
- Field of View Rotation (0018,7032),
- Field of View Horizontal Flip (0018,7034).

For the Digital X-Ray IODs, the Active Area, i.e. that part of the detector matrix that was activated for this exposure, is usually rectangular in shape. The shape and size of the Active Area and the size and spacing of the detectors are defined by the following Attributes:
- Detector Active Shape (0018,7024),
- Detector Active Dimensions (0018,7026),
- Detector Element Physical Size (0018,7020),
- Detector Element Spacing (0018,7022).

Notes:  1. The Detector Element Physical Size (0018,7020) and Detector Element Spacing (0018,7022) may be different if there are insensitive regions between each detector.
  2. This model of description is not able to accurately describe multiple matrices of detectors that are “tiled” to produce a single image.

The following optional Attribute defines the relationship of the Active Area to the Physical Detector Area:
- Detector Active Origin (0018,7028).

The relationship between detectors and stored image pixels is defined by Detector Binning (0018,701A) which specifies how many detectors, in each of the row and column directions, contribute to (are pooled or averaged to form) a single stored image pixel.
Note:  Detector Binning (0018,701A) may have values less than one if sub-sampling is used to derive an image with higher spatial resolution than the detector matrix.

      <section ref="C.7.6.1.1.5" name="">The Attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) conveys that the Image has undergone lossy compression. It provides a means to record that the Image has been compressed (at a point in its lifetime) with a lossy algorithm and changes have been introduced into the pixel data. Once the value has been set to “01”, it shall not be reset.
Note:  If an image is compressed with a lossy algorithm, the attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01”. Subsequently, if the image is decompressed and transferred in uncompressed format, this attribute value remains “01”.

The value of the Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) Attribute in SOP Instances containing multiple frames in which one or more of the frames have undergone lossy compression shall be “01”.
Note:  It is recommended that the applicable frames be noted in the Attribute Derivation Description (0008,2111).

If an image is originally obtained as a lossy compressed image from the sensor, then Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01” and Value 1 of the Attribute Image Type (0008,0008) shall be set to ORIGINAL.
If an image is a compressed version of another image, Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01”, Value 1 of the Attribute Image Type (0008,0008) shall be set to DERIVED, and if the predecessor was a DICOM image, then the Image shall receive a new SOP Instance UID.
Note:  1. It is recommended that the approximate compression ratio be provided in the Attribute Derivation Description (0008,2111). Furthermore, it is recommended that Derivation Description (0008,2111) be used to indicate when pixel data changes might affect professional interpretation. (see C.7.6.1.1.3).
  2. The attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is defined as Type 3 for backward compatibility with existing IODs. It is expected to be required (i.e., defined as Type 1C) for new Image IODs and for existing IODs that undergo a major revision (e.g. a new IOD is specified).

      <description>Window Center for display. See C.11.2.1.2 for further explanation.
Meaningful only if Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME2.</description>
      <section ref="C.11.2.1.2" name="">Window Center (0028,1050) and Window Width (0028,1051) specify a linear conversion from stored pixel values (after any Modality LUT or Rescale Slope and Intercept specified in the IOD have been applied) to values to be displayed. Window Center contains the input value that is the center of the window. Window Width contains the width of the window.
Note:  The terms “window center” and “window width” are not consistently used in practice, nor were they defined in previous versions of the standard. The definitions here are presented for the purpose of defining consistent meanings for identity and threshold transformations while preserving the common practice of using integral values for center and width.

Window Width (0028,1051) shall always be greater than or equal to 1.
When Window Width (0028,1051) is greater than 1, these Attributes select the range of input values that are to be mapped to the full range of the displayed output.
When Window Width (0028,1051) is equal to 1, they specify a threshold below which input values will be displayed as the minimum output value.
Note:  Whether the minimum output value is rendered as black or white may depend on the value of Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) or the presence of a Presentation LUT Module.

These Attributes are applied according to the following pseudo-code, where x is the input value, y is an output value with a range from ymin to ymax, c is Window Center (0028,1050) and w is Window Width (0028,1051):
    if  (x &lt;= c - 0.5 - (w-1)/2), then y = ymin
    else if  (x &gt; c - 0.5 + (w-1)/2), then y = ymax,
    else  y = ((x - (c - 0.5)) / (w-1) + 0.5) * (ymax - ymin)+ ymin

Notes:  1. For the purpose of this definition, a floating point calculation without integer truncation is assumed, though the manner of implementation may vary as long as the result is the same.
  2. The pseudo-code function computes a continuous value over the output range without any discontinuity at the boundaries. The value of 0 for w is expressly forbidden, and the value of 1 for w does not cause division by zero, since the continuous segment of the function will never be reached for that case.
  3. For example, for an output range 0 to 255:
    c=2048, w=4096 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= 0) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; 4095) then y = 255
      else y = ((x - 2047.5) / 4095 + 0.5) * (255-0) + 0
    c=2048, w=1 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= 2047.5) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; 2047.5) then y = 255
      else /* not reached */

    c=0, w=100 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= -50) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; 49) then y = 255
      else y = ((x + 0.5) / 99 + 0.5) * (255-0) + 0
    c=0, w=1 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= -0.5) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; -0.5) then y = 255
      else /* not reached */

  4. A Window Center of 2n-1 and a Window Width of 2n selects the range of input values from 0 to 2n-1. This represents an identity VOI LUT transformation in the case where no Modality LUT is specified and the stored pixel data are n bit unsigned integers.
  5. A Window Width of 1 is typically used to represent a "threshold" operation in which those integer input values less than the Window Center are represented as the minimum displayed value and those greater than or equal to the Window Center are represented as the maximum displayed value. A Window Width of 2 will have the same result for integral input values.
  6. The application of Window Center (0028,1050) and Window Width (0028,1051) may select a signed input range. There is no implication that this signed input range is clipped to zero.
  7. The selected input range may exceed the actual range of the input values, thus effectively “compressing” the contrast range of the displayed data into a narrower band of the available contrast range, and “flattening” the appearance. There are no limits to the maximum value of the window width, or to the minimum or maximum value of window level, both of which may exceed the actual or possible range of input values.
  8. Input values "below" the window are displayed as the minimum output value and input values "above" the window are displayed as the maximum output value. This is the common usage of the window operation in medical imaging. There is no provision for an alternative approach in which all values "outside" the window are displayed as the minimum output value.
  9. The output of the Window Center/Width or VOI LUT transformation is either implicitly scaled to the full range of the display device if there is no succeeding transformation defined, or implicitly scaled to the full input range of the succeeding transformation step (such as the Presentation LUT), if present. See C.11.6.1.
  10. Fractional values of Window Center and Window Width are permitted (since the VR of these Attributes is Decimal String), and though they are not often encountered, applications should be prepared to accept them.

These Attributes shall be used only for Images with Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) values of MONOCHROME1 and MONOCHROME2. They have no meaning for other Images.
If multiple values are present, both Attributes shall have the same number of values and shall be considered as pairs. Multiple values indicate that multiple alternative views may be presented.
If any VOI LUT Table is included by an Image, a Window Width and Window Center or the VOI LUT Table, but not both, may be applied to the Image for display. Inclusion of both indicates that multiple alternative views may be presented.
If multiple items are present in VOI LUT Sequence (0028,3010), only one may be applied to the Image for display. Multiple items indicate that multiple alternative views may be presented.
If the VOI LUT Module is defined in an IOD and if neither a VOI LUT Sequence nor a Window Width and Window Center are present, then the VOI LUT stage of the grayscale pipeline is defined to be an identity transformation.
Notes:  1. This requirement is specified so that IODs that define a particular output space for the grayscale pipeline, such as P-Values, are not in an undefined state when no VOI LUT Sequence or Window Width and Window Center are present.
  2. Despite the Type 3 requirement for VOI LUT Sequence and Window Center, implementations that render images are expected to implement and apply these transformations when they are present in the image, unless overridden by the user, a presentation state, or a hanging protocol, and to allow the user to select which transformation to apply when multiple transformations are present.

      <description>Window Width for display. See C.11.2.1.2 for further explanation.
Required if Window Center (0028,1050) is present.</description>
      <section ref="C.11.2.1.2" name="">Window Center (0028,1050) and Window Width (0028,1051) specify a linear conversion from stored pixel values (after any Modality LUT or Rescale Slope and Intercept specified in the IOD have been applied) to values to be displayed. Window Center contains the input value that is the center of the window. Window Width contains the width of the window.
Note:  The terms “window center” and “window width” are not consistently used in practice, nor were they defined in previous versions of the standard. The definitions here are presented for the purpose of defining consistent meanings for identity and threshold transformations while preserving the common practice of using integral values for center and width.

Window Width (0028,1051) shall always be greater than or equal to 1.
When Window Width (0028,1051) is greater than 1, these Attributes select the range of input values that are to be mapped to the full range of the displayed output.
When Window Width (0028,1051) is equal to 1, they specify a threshold below which input values will be displayed as the minimum output value.
Note:  Whether the minimum output value is rendered as black or white may depend on the value of Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) or the presence of a Presentation LUT Module.

These Attributes are applied according to the following pseudo-code, where x is the input value, y is an output value with a range from ymin to ymax, c is Window Center (0028,1050) and w is Window Width (0028,1051):
    if  (x &lt;= c - 0.5 - (w-1)/2), then y = ymin
    else if  (x &gt; c - 0.5 + (w-1)/2), then y = ymax,
    else  y = ((x - (c - 0.5)) / (w-1) + 0.5) * (ymax - ymin)+ ymin

Notes:  1. For the purpose of this definition, a floating point calculation without integer truncation is assumed, though the manner of implementation may vary as long as the result is the same.
  2. The pseudo-code function computes a continuous value over the output range without any discontinuity at the boundaries. The value of 0 for w is expressly forbidden, and the value of 1 for w does not cause division by zero, since the continuous segment of the function will never be reached for that case.
  3. For example, for an output range 0 to 255:
    c=2048, w=4096 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= 0) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; 4095) then y = 255
      else y = ((x - 2047.5) / 4095 + 0.5) * (255-0) + 0
    c=2048, w=1 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= 2047.5) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; 2047.5) then y = 255
      else /* not reached */

    c=0, w=100 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= -50) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; 49) then y = 255
      else y = ((x + 0.5) / 99 + 0.5) * (255-0) + 0
    c=0, w=1 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= -0.5) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; -0.5) then y = 255
      else /* not reached */

  4. A Window Center of 2n-1 and a Window Width of 2n selects the range of input values from 0 to 2n-1. This represents an identity VOI LUT transformation in the case where no Modality LUT is specified and the stored pixel data are n bit unsigned integers.
  5. A Window Width of 1 is typically used to represent a "threshold" operation in which those integer input values less than the Window Center are represented as the minimum displayed value and those greater than or equal to the Window Center are represented as the maximum displayed value. A Window Width of 2 will have the same result for integral input values.
  6. The application of Window Center (0028,1050) and Window Width (0028,1051) may select a signed input range. There is no implication that this signed input range is clipped to zero.
  7. The selected input range may exceed the actual range of the input values, thus effectively “compressing” the contrast range of the displayed data into a narrower band of the available contrast range, and “flattening” the appearance. There are no limits to the maximum value of the window width, or to the minimum or maximum value of window level, both of which may exceed the actual or possible range of input values.
  8. Input values "below" the window are displayed as the minimum output value and input values "above" the window are displayed as the maximum output value. This is the common usage of the window operation in medical imaging. There is no provision for an alternative approach in which all values "outside" the window are displayed as the minimum output value.
  9. The output of the Window Center/Width or VOI LUT transformation is either implicitly scaled to the full range of the display device if there is no succeeding transformation defined, or implicitly scaled to the full input range of the succeeding transformation step (such as the Presentation LUT), if present. See C.11.6.1.
  10. Fractional values of Window Center and Window Width are permitted (since the VR of these Attributes is Decimal String), and though they are not often encountered, applications should be prepared to accept them.

These Attributes shall be used only for Images with Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) values of MONOCHROME1 and MONOCHROME2. They have no meaning for other Images.

Note:  In Slide Microscopy (SM), the Microscope is equipped with a moveable Stage and position sensors that enable storage of the location of the center point of the displayed image with respect to the examined Specimen.

The Stage is the part of the Microscope to which the Slide is attached for viewing. The Objective Lens is the lens that is closest to the Specimen. The Top Surface of the Slide is the surface of the Slide on which the Specimen in Mounted. The Bottom Surface of the Slide is the opposite surface. This Specification presumes that: 1) the Slide is rectangular; 2) the Top Surface of the Slide is oriented toward the Objective Lens of the Microscope; and 3) the Bottom Surface of the Slide is in perfect contact with the Microscope Stage when the Slide is attached to the Stage for viewing.
Notes:  1. The Label of the Slide is presumed to be mounted-on or written-on the Top Surface of the Slide.
  2. Specification of the mechanical form, function, or tolerances of the Microscope are outside the scope of this Standard.

Figure C.8-16 depicts the Top Surface of the Slide on the Microscope Stage from the perspective of the Objective Lens. This is Reference Slide Orientation. The X, Y, and Z axes of the Slide Coordinate System in Reference Slide Orientation are defined as follows. The Y-axis is a line that includes the Left Edge of the Slide. The X-axis is a line that is orthogonal to the Y-axis and includes at least one point of the Specimen Edge of the Slide. The Z-axis is a line that passes through the intersection of the X-axis and Y-axis and is orthogonal to the Microscope Stage. The Origin (0,0,0) of the Slide Coordinate System is the point of intersection of the X, Y, and Z axes.

REFERENCE SLIDE ORIENTATION

Notes:  1. An improperly-placed coverslip or Specimen that overlaps an Edge of a Slide is not considered part of the Edge a Slide for purposes of defining the Slide Coordinate System. However, such objects may cause inaccurate positioning of the Slide on the Stage.
  2. If the Left Edge and Specimen Edge of the Slide are not orthogonal (e.g. the Slide is damaged or defective or the Specimen Edge is curvilinear), then the lower left-hand corner of the Slide may not be located at the Origin.
  3. The definitions of X, Y, and Z axes are the same for inverted microscopes, with the Top Surface of the slide (i.e. Specimen side of the Slide) still being closest to the Objective Lens.

Figure C.8-17 depicts the Z-axis center point location. The X-axis value of Image Center Point Location (0040,073A) shall increase from the Origin toward the Right Edge in Reference Slide Orientation. The Y-axis value of Image Center Point Location (0040,073A) shall increase from the Origin toward the Label Edge in Reference Slide Orientation. The Z-axis value of Image Center Point Location (0040,073A) shall be referenced as zero at the image substrate reference plane (i.e. utilized surface of a glass slide) and shall increase in a positive fashion coincident with increased distance from the substrate surface.

      <section ref="C.7.6.3.1.2" name="">The value of Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) specifies the intended interpretation of the image pixel data.
See PS 3.5 for restrictions imposed by compressed Transfer Syntaxes.
The following values are defined. Other values are permitted but the meaning is not defined by this Standard.
MONOCHROME1 = Pixel data represent a single monochrome image plane. The minimum sample value is intended to be displayed as white after any VOI gray scale transformations have been performed. See PS 3.4. This value may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 1.
MONOCHROME2 = Pixel data represent a single monochrome image plane. The minimum sample value is intended to be displayed as black after any VOI gray scale transformations have been performed. See PS 3.4. This value may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 1.
PALETTE COLOR = Pixel data describe a color image with a single sample per pixel (single image plane). The pixel value is used as an index into each of the Red, Blue, and Green Palette Color Lookup Tables (0028,1101-1103&amp;1201-1203). This value may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 1. When the Photometric Interpretation is Palette Color; Red, Blue, and Green Palette Color Lookup Tables shall be present.
RGB = Pixel data represent a color image described by red, green, and blue image planes. The minimum sample value for each color plane represents minimum intensity of the color. This value may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 3.
HSV = Retired.
ARGB = Retired.
CMYK = Retired.
YBR_FULL = Pixel data represent a color image described by one luminance (Y) and two chrominance planes (CB and CR). This photometric interpretation may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 3. Black is represented by Y equal to zero. The absence of color is represented by both CB and CR values equal to half full scale.
Note:  In the case where the Bits Allocated (0028,0100) has value of 8 half full scale is 128.

In the case where Bits Allocated (0028,0100) has a value of 8 then the following equations convert between RGB and YCBCR Photometric Interpretation.
Y =  +  .2990R  +  .5870G  +  .1140B
CB =  -  .1687R  -  .3313G  +  .5000B  +  128
CR =  +  .5000R  -  .4187G  -  .0813B  +  128
Note:  The above is based on CCIR Recommendation 601-2 dated 1990.

YBR_FULL_422 = The same as YBR_FULL except that the CB and CR values are sampled horizontally at half the Y rate and as a result there are half as many CB and CR values as Y values.
This Photometric Interpretation is only allowed with Planar Configuration (0028,0006) equal to 0. Two Y values shall be stored followed by one CB and one CR value. The CB and CR values shall be sampled at the location of the first of the two Y values. For each Row of Pixels, the first CB and CR samples shall be at the location of the first Y sample. The next CB and CR samples shall be at the location of the third Y sample etc.
Note:  This subsampling is often referred to as cosited sampling.

YBR_PARTIAL_422 = The same as YBR_FULL_422 except that:
1. black corresponds to Y = 16;
2. Y is restricted to 220 levels (i.e. the maximum value is 235);
3. CB and CR each has a minimum value of 16;
4. CB and CR are restricted to 225 levels (i.e. the maximum value is 240);
5. lack of color is represented by CB and CR equal to 128.
In the case where Bits Allocated (0028,0100) has value of 8 then the following equations convert between RGB and YBR_PARTIAL_422 Photometric Interpretation
Y =  +  .2568R  +  .5041G  +  .0979B  +  16
CB =  -  .1482R  -  .2910G  +  .4392B  +  128
CR =  +  .4392R  -  .3678G  -  .0714B  +  128
Note:  The above is based on CCIR Recommendation 601-2 dated 1990.

YBR_PARTIAL_420 = The same as YBR_PARTIAL_422 except that the CB and CR values are sampled horizontally and vertically at half the Y rate and as a result there are four times less CB and CR values than Y values, versus twice less for YBR_PARTIAL_422.
This Photometric Interpretation is only allowed with Planar Configuration (0028,0006) equal to 0. The CB and CR values shall be sampled at the location of the first of the two Y values. For the first Row of Pixels (etc.), the first CB and CR samples shall be at the location of the first Y sample. The next CB and CR samples shall be at the location of the third Y sample etc. The next Rows of Pixels containing CB and CR samples (at the same locations than for the first Row) will be the third etc.
YBR_ICT = Irreversible Color Transformation:
Pixel data represent a color image described by one luminance (Y) and two chrominance planes (CB and CR). This photometric interpretation may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 3. Black is represented by Y equal to zero. The absence of color is represented by both CB and CR values equal to zero.
Regardless of the value of Bits Allocated (0028,0100), the following equations convert between RGB and YCBCR Photometric Interpretation.
Y =  +  .29900R  +  .58700G  +  .11400B
CB =  -  .16875R  -  .33126G  +  .50000B
CR =  +  .50000R  -  .41869G  -  .08131B
Notes:  1. The above is based on ISO/IEC 15444-1 (JPEG 2000).
  2. In a JPEG 2000 bitstream, DC level shifting (used if the untransformed components are unsigned) is applied before forward color transformation, and the transformed components may be signed (unlike in JPEG ISO/IEC 10918-1).
  3. In JPEG 2000, spatial down-sampling of the chrominance components, if performed, is signaled in the JPEG 2000 bitstream.

YBR_RCT = Reversible Color Transformation:
Pixel data represent a color image described by one luminance (Y) and two chrominance planes (CB and CR). This photometric interpretation may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 3. Black is represented by Y equal to zero. The absence of color is represented by both CB and CR values equal to zero.
Regardless of the value of Bits Allocated (0028,0100), the following equations convert between RGB and YBR_RCT Photometric Interpretation.
Y = R + 2G +B) / 4        (Note:  mean floor)
CB = B - G
CR = R - G
The following equations convert between YBR_RCT and RGB Photometric Interpretation.
G = Y –  (CR + CB) / 4
R = CR + G
B = CB + G
Notes:  1. The above is based on ISO/IEC 15444-1 (JPEG 2000).
  2. In a JPEG 2000 bitstream, DC level shifting (used if the untransformed components are unsigned) is applied before forward color transformation, and the transformed components may be signed (unlike in JPEG ISO/IEC 10918-1).
  3. This photometric interpretation is a reversible approximation to the YUV transformation used in PAL and SECAM.

      <description>Specifies whether an Image has undergone lossy compression.
Enumerated Values:
00 = Image has NOT been subjected to lossy compression.
01 = Image has been subjected to lossy compression.
See C.7.6.1.1.5 for further explanation.</description>
      <section ref="C.7.6.1.1.5" name="">The Attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) conveys that the Image has undergone lossy compression. It provides a means to record that the Image has been compressed (at a point in its lifetime) with a lossy algorithm and changes have been introduced into the pixel data. Once the value has been set to “01”, it shall not be reset.
Note:  If an image is compressed with a lossy algorithm, the attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01”. Subsequently, if the image is decompressed and transferred in uncompressed format, this attribute value remains “01”.

The value of the Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) Attribute in SOP Instances containing multiple frames in which one or more of the frames have undergone lossy compression shall be “01”.
Note:  It is recommended that the applicable frames be noted in the Attribute Derivation Description (0008,2111).

If an image is originally obtained as a lossy compressed image from the sensor, then Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01” and Value 1 of the Attribute Image Type (0008,0008) shall be set to ORIGINAL.
If an image is a compressed version of another image, Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01”, Value 1 of the Attribute Image Type (0008,0008) shall be set to DERIVED, and if the predecessor was a DICOM image, then the Image shall receive a new SOP Instance UID.
Note:  1. It is recommended that the approximate compression ratio be provided in the Attribute Derivation Description (0008,2111). Furthermore, it is recommended that Derivation Description (0008,2111) be used to indicate when pixel data changes might affect professional interpretation. (see C.7.6.1.1.3).
  2. The attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is defined as Type 3 for backward compatibility with existing IODs. It is expected to be required (i.e., defined as Type 1C) for new Image IODs and for existing IODs that undergo a major revision (e.g. a new IOD is specified).
The Defined Terms for Lossy Image Compression Method (0028,2114) are:
ISO_10918_1 = JPEG Lossy Compression
ISO_14495_1 = JPEG-LS Near-lossless Compression
ISO_15444_1 = JPEG 2000 Irreversible Compression

Enumerated Values and Defined Terms are the same as those for the four values of the Image Type (0008,0008) attribute, except that the value MIXED is not allowed. See C.8.16.1 and C.8.13.3.1.1.</description>
      <section ref="C.8.16.1" name="">The Image Type (0008,0008) and associated Image Type related attributes provide a high level description of a multi-frame SOP Instance. These attributes describe properties that provide key summary information to users of the SOP Instance. Image Type (0008,0008) contains the highest level summary of what is in the SOP Instance.
The Frame Type (0008,9007) attribute mirrors the corresponding Image Type attribute and applies to the frame level rather than to the image level.
If more than one value is used by the set of frames for a given Frame Type (0008,9007) attribute value or associated attribute value then the corresponding value of the Image Type (0008,0008) or associated attribute shall contain a value of MIXED. This indicates that a mixed set of values exists within the multi-frame SOP Instance.
The value MIXED shall only be used in the Image Type (0008,0008) when the corresponding values for the individual frames are not equal. When a value of an attribute is equal for all frames, the same value shall be used for the corresponding value of the Image Type (0008,0008). Values 2 and 3 of Image Type (0008,0008) are an exception to the rule for MIXED: Values 2 and 3 may never have the value of MIXED as described in sections C.8.16.1.2 and C.8.16.1.3.
Image Type (0008,0008) and Frame Type (0008,9007) shall consist of four non-zero length values.

      <section ref="C.7.6.2.1.1" name="">The Image Position (0020,0032) specifies the x, y, and z coordinates of the upper left hand corner of the image; it is the center of the first voxel transmitted. Image Orientation (0020,0037) specifies the direction cosines of the first row and the first column with respect to the patient. These Attributes shall be provide as a pair. Row value for the x, y, and z axes respectively followed by the Column value for the x, y, and z axes respectively.
The direction of the axes is defined fully by the patient’s orientation. The x-axis is increasing to the left hand side of the patient. The y-axis is increasing to the posterior side of the patient. The z-axis is increasing toward the head of the patient.
The patient based coordinate system is a right handed system, i.e. the vector cross product of a unit vector along the positive x-axis and a unit vector along the positive y-axis is equal to a unit vector along the positive z-axis.
Note  If a patient lies parallel to the ground, face-up on the table, with his feet-to-head direction same as the front-to-back direction of the imaging equipment, the direction of the axes of this patient based coordinate system and the equipment based coordinate system in previous versions of this Standard will coincide.

The Image Plane Attributes, in conjunction with the Pixel Spacing Attribute, describe the position and orientation of the image slices relative to the patient-based coordinate system. In each image frame the Image Position (Patient) (0020,0032) specifies the origin of the image with respect to the patient-based coordinate system. RCS and the Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037) attribute values specify the orientation of the image frame rows and columns. The mapping of pixel location  to the RCS is calculated as follows:

        size 12{ left [ matrix {

      <section ref="C.8.14.4.1" name="">The Spectroscopy Data attribute (5600,0020) contains the Signal intensities for the spectra. The order of voxels sent for each spectral plane is left to right, top to bottom, i.e., the upper left voxel (labeled 1,1) is sent first followed by the remainder of row 1, followed by the first voxel of row 2 (labeled 2,1) then the remainder of row 2 and so on. Each "voxel" represents an entire spectrum. The complete spectral data from each voxel is sent, followed by the spectral data from the next voxel position.
The number of voxels on each frame are described by Rows (0028,0010) and Columns (0028,0011). The number of frames is described by Number of Frames (0028,0008). The frames may represent different locations in a 3D acquisition, or the same position at a different point of time, or a difference of some other combination of attributes.
Note:  Either Rows or Columns or both may have a value of 1 (e.g., for single voxel spectroscopy). A value of zero for the corresponding value of Pixel Spacing in the Pixel Measures Macro is permitted under these circumstances. See 10.7.1.3.

The spectral data points are ordered from lower effective magnetic field strength (down-field) to higher effective magnetic field strength (up-field) when the Signal Domain Columns (0028,9003) or Signal Domain Rows (0028,9235) attributes contain the value FREQUENCY and from first sample acquired to last sample acquired when the Signal Domain Columns (0028,9003) or Signal Domain Rows (0028,9235) attributes contain the value TIME.
For two-dimensional spectral acquisitions, the ordering is such that all data points from a row (corresponding to all data points acquired in an individual sampling period), are followed by all data points from the successive sampling period. Following all data of the rows from a given voxel position, the data from the subsequent voxel position are sent. The axis parallel to the row direction corresponds to the sampling time axis. The axis parallel to the column direction corresponds to the evolution time axis.
The dimensions of each spectrum that make up a voxel are described by Data Point Rows (0028,9001) and Data Point Columns (0028,9002). In the case of 1D spectra, the number of Data Point Rows shall be 1.
For a Data Representation (0028,9108) value of COMPLEX, the order of data points is real channel followed by imaginary channel for each spectral data point. For the other Data Representation values (REAL, IMAGINARY and MAGNITUDE), each spectral data point contains only a single value.
The Figure C.8-18 depicts 6 frames each made up of 4 rows and 4 columns of voxels. Specific values for Data Point Rows (0028,9001) and Data Point Columns (0028,9002) of these voxels are not depicted.

      <description>Specifies the intended interpretation of the pixel data. Enumerated Value: MONOCHROME2.
See C.7.6.3.1.2 for definition of this term.</description>
      <section ref="C.7.6.3.1.2" name="">The value of Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) specifies the intended interpretation of the image pixel data.
See PS 3.5 for restrictions imposed by compressed Transfer Syntaxes.
The following values are defined. Other values are permitted but the meaning is not defined by this Standard.
MONOCHROME1 = Pixel data represent a single monochrome image plane. The minimum sample value is intended to be displayed as white after any VOI gray scale transformations have been performed. See PS 3.4. This value may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 1.
MONOCHROME2 = Pixel data represent a single monochrome image plane. The minimum sample value is intended to be displayed as black after any VOI gray scale transformations have been performed. See PS 3.4. This value may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 1.
PALETTE COLOR = Pixel data describe a color image with a single sample per pixel (single image plane). The pixel value is used as an index into each of the Red, Blue, and Green Palette Color Lookup Tables (0028,1101-1103&amp;1201-1203). This value may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 1. When the Photometric Interpretation is Palette Color; Red, Blue, and Green Palette Color Lookup Tables shall be present.
RGB = Pixel data represent a color image described by red, green, and blue image planes. The minimum sample value for each color plane represents minimum intensity of the color. This value may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 3.
HSV = Retired.
ARGB = Retired.
CMYK = Retired.
YBR_FULL = Pixel data represent a color image described by one luminance (Y) and two chrominance planes (CB and CR). This photometric interpretation may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 3. Black is represented by Y equal to zero. The absence of color is represented by both CB and CR values equal to half full scale.
Note:  In the case where the Bits Allocated (0028,0100) has value of 8 half full scale is 128.

In the case where Bits Allocated (0028,0100) has a value of 8 then the following equations convert between RGB and YCBCR Photometric Interpretation.
Y =  +  .2990R  +  .5870G  +  .1140B
CB =  -  .1687R  -  .3313G  +  .5000B  +  128
CR =  +  .5000R  -  .4187G  -  .0813B  +  128
Note:  The above is based on CCIR Recommendation 601-2 dated 1990.

YBR_FULL_422 = The same as YBR_FULL except that the CB and CR values are sampled horizontally at half the Y rate and as a result there are half as many CB and CR values as Y values.
This Photometric Interpretation is only allowed with Planar Configuration (0028,0006) equal to 0. Two Y values shall be stored followed by one CB and one CR value. The CB and CR values shall be sampled at the location of the first of the two Y values. For each Row of Pixels, the first CB and CR samples shall be at the location of the first Y sample. The next CB and CR samples shall be at the location of the third Y sample etc.
Note:  This subsampling is often referred to as cosited sampling.

YBR_PARTIAL_422 = The same as YBR_FULL_422 except that:
1. black corresponds to Y = 16;
2. Y is restricted to 220 levels (i.e. the maximum value is 235);
3. CB and CR each has a minimum value of 16;
4. CB and CR are restricted to 225 levels (i.e. the maximum value is 240);
5. lack of color is represented by CB and CR equal to 128.
In the case where Bits Allocated (0028,0100) has value of 8 then the following equations convert between RGB and YBR_PARTIAL_422 Photometric Interpretation
Y =  +  .2568R  +  .5041G  +  .0979B  +  16
CB =  -  .1482R  -  .2910G  +  .4392B  +  128
CR =  +  .4392R  -  .3678G  -  .0714B  +  128
Note:  The above is based on CCIR Recommendation 601-2 dated 1990.

YBR_PARTIAL_420 = The same as YBR_PARTIAL_422 except that the CB and CR values are sampled horizontally and vertically at half the Y rate and as a result there are four times less CB and CR values than Y values, versus twice less for YBR_PARTIAL_422.
This Photometric Interpretation is only allowed with Planar Configuration (0028,0006) equal to 0. The CB and CR values shall be sampled at the location of the first of the two Y values. For the first Row of Pixels (etc.), the first CB and CR samples shall be at the location of the first Y sample. The next CB and CR samples shall be at the location of the third Y sample etc. The next Rows of Pixels containing CB and CR samples (at the same locations than for the first Row) will be the third etc.
YBR_ICT = Irreversible Color Transformation:
Pixel data represent a color image described by one luminance (Y) and two chrominance planes (CB and CR). This photometric interpretation may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 3. Black is represented by Y equal to zero. The absence of color is represented by both CB and CR values equal to zero.
Regardless of the value of Bits Allocated (0028,0100), the following equations convert between RGB and YCBCR Photometric Interpretation.
Y =  +  .29900R  +  .58700G  +  .11400B
CB =  -  .16875R  -  .33126G  +  .50000B
CR =  +  .50000R  -  .41869G  -  .08131B
Notes:  1. The above is based on ISO/IEC 15444-1 (JPEG 2000).
  2. In a JPEG 2000 bitstream, DC level shifting (used if the untransformed components are unsigned) is applied before forward color transformation, and the transformed components may be signed (unlike in JPEG ISO/IEC 10918-1).
  3. In JPEG 2000, spatial down-sampling of the chrominance components, if performed, is signaled in the JPEG 2000 bitstream.

YBR_RCT = Reversible Color Transformation:
Pixel data represent a color image described by one luminance (Y) and two chrominance planes (CB and CR). This photometric interpretation may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 3. Black is represented by Y equal to zero. The absence of color is represented by both CB and CR values equal to zero.
Regardless of the value of Bits Allocated (0028,0100), the following equations convert between RGB and YBR_RCT Photometric Interpretation.
Y = R + 2G +B) / 4        (Note:  mean floor)
CB = B - G
CR = R - G
The following equations convert between YBR_RCT and RGB Photometric Interpretation.
G = Y –  (CR + CB) / 4
R = CR + G
B = CB + G
Notes:  1. The above is based on ISO/IEC 15444-1 (JPEG 2000).
  2. In a JPEG 2000 bitstream, DC level shifting (used if the untransformed components are unsigned) is applied before forward color transformation, and the transformed components may be signed (unlike in JPEG ISO/IEC 10918-1).
  3. This photometric interpretation is a reversible approximation to the YUV transformation used in PAL and SECAM.

      <section ref="C.8.15.3.2.1" name="">Acquisition Type (0018,9302) has the following Defined Terms:
SEQUENCED  identifies that the acquisition was performed by acquiring single or multi detector data while rotating the source about the gantry while the table is not moving. Additional slices are acquired by incrementing the table position and again rotating the source about the gantry while the table is not moving.
SPIRAL  identifies that the acquisition was performed by acquiring data while rotating the source about the gantry while continuously moving the table.
CONSTANT_ANGLE  identifies that the acquisition was performed by holding the source at a constant angle and moving the table to obtain a projection image (e.g., a localizer image).
STATIONARY  identifies that the acquisition was performed by holding the table at a constant position and acquiring multiple slices over time at the same location.
FREE  identifies that the acquisition was performed while rotating the source about the gantry while the table movement is under direct control of a human operator or under the control of an analysis application (e.g., fluoroscopic image).

      <section ref="C.7.6.3.1.1" name="">Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) is the number of separate planes in this image. One, three, and four image planes are defined. Other numbers of image planes are allowed, but their meaning is not defined by this Standard.
For monochrome (gray scale) and palette color images, the number of planes is 1. For RGB and other three vector color models, the value of this attribute is 3. For four vector color models, the value of this attribute is 4.
All image planes shall have the same number of Rows (0028,0010), Columns (0028,0011), Bits Allocated (0028,0100), Bits Stored (0028,0101), High Bit (0028,0102), Pixel Representation (0028,0103), and Pixel Aspect Ratio (0028,0034).
The data in each pixel may be represented as a “Composite Pixel Code”. If Samples Per Pixel is one, the Composite Pixel Code is just the “n” bit pixel sample, where “n” = Bits Allocated. If Samples Per Pixel is greater than one, Composite Pixel Code is a “k” bit concatenation of samples, where “k” = Bits Allocated multiplied by Samples Per Pixel, and with the sample representing the vector color designated first in the Photometric Interpretation name comprising the most significant bits of the Composite Pixel Code, followed in order by the samples representing the next vector colors, with the sample representing the vector color designated last in the Photometric Interpretation name comprising the least significant bits of the Composite Pixel Code. For example, for Photometric Interpretation = “RGB”, the most significant “Bits Allocated” bits contain the Red sample, the next “Bits Allocated” bits contain the Green sample, and the least significant “Bits Allocated” bits contain the Blue sample.

Note:  If an image is compressed with a lossy algorithm, the attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01”. Subsequently, if the image is decompressed and transferred in uncompressed format, this attribute value remains “01”.

The value of the Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) Attribute in SOP Instances containing multiple frames in which one or more of the frames have undergone lossy compression shall be “01”.
Note:  It is recommended that the applicable frames be noted in the Attribute Derivation Description (0008,2111).

      <section ref="C.7.6.1.1.3" name="">If an Image is identified to be a derived image (see C.7.6.1.1.2 Image Type), Derivation Description (0008,2111) and Derivation Code Sequence (0008,9215) describe the way in which the image was derived. They may be used whether or not the Source Image Sequence (0008,2112) is provided. They may also be used in cases when the Derived Image pixel data is not significantly changed from one of the source images and the SOP Instance UID of the Derived Image is the same as the one used for the source image.
Notes:  1. Examples of Derived Images that would normally be expected to affect professional interpretation and would thus have a new UID include:
  a.  images resulting from image processing of another image (e.g. unsharp masking),
  b.  a multiplanar reformatted CT image,
  c.  a DSA image derived by subtracting pixel values of one image from another.
d.  an image that has been decompressed after having been compressed with a lossy compression algorithm. To ensure that the user has the necessary information about the lossy compression, the approximate compression ratio may be included in Derivation Description (0008,2111).
  An example of a Derived Image that would normally not be expected to affect professional interpretation and thus would not require a new UID is an image that has been padded with additional rows and columns for more display purposes.
  2. An image may be lossy compressed, e.g., for long term archive purposes, and its SOP Instance UID changed. PS3.4 provides a mechanism by which a query for the original image Instance may return a reference to the UID of the lossy compressed version of the image using the Alternate Representation Sequence (0008,3001). This allows an application processing a SOP Instance that references the original image UID, e.g., a Structured Report, to obtain a reference to an accessible version of the image even if the original SOP Instance is no longer available.

Note:  Some of these Attributes relate the image data to manufacturer specific characteristics of the detector that may be used for quality control purposes, e.g. correlation of image artifacts with a detector defect map, analysis of noise performance, etc.

The Displayed Area is defined in pixel coordinates relative to the stored image pixel values by the Attributes of the Display Shutter Module (see section C.7.6.11). If this Module is not present or supported, then the Displayed Area is equal to the Field of View.
The Exposed Area is defined in pixel coordinates relative to the stored image pixel values by the Attributes of the X-Ray Collimator Module (see section C.8.7.3).
For the Digital X-Ray IODs, the Field of View is usually rectangular in shape and the same size as the stored Pixel Data (7FE0,0010). The shape and size of the Field of View and the spacing of the pixels are defined by the following Attributes:
- Field of View Shape (0018,1147),
- Field of View Dimensions (0018,1149),
- Imager Pixel Spacing (0018,1164),
- Rows (0028,0010),
- Columns (0028,0011)

The following Attributes define the relationship of the Field of View to the Physical Detector Area:
- Field of View Origin (0018,7030),
- Field of View Rotation (0018,7032),
- Field of View Horizontal Flip (0018,7034).

For the Digital X-Ray IODs, the Active Area, i.e. that part of the detector matrix that was activated for this exposure, is usually rectangular in shape. The shape and size of the Active Area and the size and spacing of the detectors are defined by the following Attributes:
- Detector Active Shape (0018,7024),
- Detector Active Dimensions (0018,7026),
- Detector Element Physical Size (0018,7020),
- Detector Element Spacing (0018,7022).

Notes:  1. The Detector Element Physical Size (0018,7020) and Detector Element Spacing (0018,7022) may be different if there are insensitive regions between each detector.
  2. This model of description is not able to accurately describe multiple matrices of detectors that are “tiled” to produce a single image.

The following optional Attribute defines the relationship of the Active Area to the Physical Detector Area:
- Detector Active Origin (0018,7028).

The relationship between detectors and stored image pixels is defined by Detector Binning (0018,701A) which specifies how many detectors, in each of the row and column directions, contribute to (are pooled or averaged to form) a single stored image pixel.
Note:  Detector Binning (0018,701A) may have values less than one if sub-sampling is used to derive an image with higher spatial resolution than the detector matrix.

Enumerated Values:
1 = Lower pixel values correspond to less X-Ray beam intensity
-1 = Higher pixel values correspond to less X-Ray beam intensity
See C.8.11.3.1.2 for further explanation.</description>
      <section ref="C.8.11.3.1.2" name="">Pixel Intensity Relationship (0028,1040) and Pixel Intensity Relationship Sign (0028,1041) describe how the stored pixel values in Pixel Data (7FE0,0010) are related to the X-Ray beam intensity incident on the detector.
They do not define a transformation intended to be applied to the pixel data for presentation.
Note:  For example, if Pixel Intensity Relationship (0028,1040) is LIN and Pixel Intensity Relationship Sign (0028,1041) is -1, then lower values of Pixel Data (7FE0,0010) indicate higher X-Ray beam intensities corresponding to less radiographically dense regions projected on the image such as through air, and higher values of Pixel Data (7FE0,0010) indicate lower X-Ray beam intensities corresponding to more radiographically dense regions projected on the image such as through bone and radio-opaque contrast agents.

The transformation to be applied to the pixel data for presentation is defined by the successive application of the conceptual Modality LUT, the VOI Attributes and the conceptual Presentation LUT. This shall result in the output of P-Values.
Rescale Slope (0028,1053) and Rescale Intercept (0028,1052) define a linear subset of a conceptual Modality LUT transformation. For IODs that include this Module, these Attributes define an identity transformation. IODs that include the DX Image Module shall not include the Modality LUT Module.
The Presentation LUT Shape (2050,0020) defines a subset of a conceptual Presentation LUT. For IODs that include this Module, this Attribute defines an identity transformation or inverse identity transformation. IODs that include the DX Image Module shall not include the Presentation LUT Module.
Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) indicates whether lower values that are the output of the VOI Attributes should be displayed as darker or lighter. Since the output of the equivalent of a conceptual Presentation LUT is in P-Values, which are defined in PS 3.14 such that lower values correspond to lower luminance levels, then the definition of the Presentation LUT Shape (2050,0020), otherwise intended to be an identity transformation, must take into account the effect of the value specified for Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004).
Note:  Regardless of the values of Pixel Intensity Relationship (0028,1040) and Pixel Intensity Relationship Sign (0028,1041), the grayscale transformations to be applied to the Pixel Data (7FE0,0010) are defined by the equivalent of the Modality LUT (Rescale Slope (0028,1053) and Rescale Intercept (0028,1052)), Value of Interest Attributes, Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) and the equivalent of the Presentation LUT (Presentation LUT Shape (2050,0020)). However, the combination of the grayscale transformations and the description of the pixel intensity relationship, together define whether, for example, air is expected to be displayed as black or white.

Note:  Some of these Attributes relate the image data to manufacturer specific characteristics of the detector that may be used for quality control purposes, e.g. correlation of image artifacts with a detector defect map, analysis of noise performance, etc.

The Displayed Area is defined in pixel coordinates relative to the stored image pixel values by the Attributes of the Display Shutter Module (see section C.7.6.11). If this Module is not present or supported, then the Displayed Area is equal to the Field of View.
The Exposed Area is defined in pixel coordinates relative to the stored image pixel values by the Attributes of the X-Ray Collimator Module (see section C.8.7.3).
For the Digital X-Ray IODs, the Field of View is usually rectangular in shape and the same size as the stored Pixel Data (7FE0,0010). The shape and size of the Field of View and the spacing of the pixels are defined by the following Attributes:
- Field of View Shape (0018,1147),
- Field of View Dimensions (0018,1149),
- Imager Pixel Spacing (0018,1164),
- Rows (0028,0010),
- Columns (0028,0011)

The following Attributes define the relationship of the Field of View to the Physical Detector Area:
- Field of View Origin (0018,7030),
- Field of View Rotation (0018,7032),
- Field of View Horizontal Flip (0018,7034).

For the Digital X-Ray IODs, the Active Area, i.e. that part of the detector matrix that was activated for this exposure, is usually rectangular in shape. The shape and size of the Active Area and the size and spacing of the detectors are defined by the following Attributes:
- Detector Active Shape (0018,7024),
- Detector Active Dimensions (0018,7026),
- Detector Element Physical Size (0018,7020),
- Detector Element Spacing (0018,7022).

Notes:  1. The Detector Element Physical Size (0018,7020) and Detector Element Spacing (0018,7022) may be different if there are insensitive regions between each detector.
  2. This model of description is not able to accurately describe multiple matrices of detectors that are “tiled” to produce a single image.

The following optional Attribute defines the relationship of the Active Area to the Physical Detector Area:
- Detector Active Origin (0018,7028).

The relationship between detectors and stored image pixels is defined by Detector Binning (0018,701A) which specifies how many detectors, in each of the row and column directions, contribute to (are pooled or averaged to form) a single stored image pixel.
Note:  Detector Binning (0018,701A) may have values less than one if sub-sampling is used to derive an image with higher spatial resolution than the detector matrix.

      <section ref="C.8.11.4.1.1" name="">The relationship between the Physical Detector Area, the Active Detector Area, the Field of View (what is stored in the Pixel Data (7FE0,0010)), the Exposed Area (after X-Ray Collimation) and the Displayed Area is illustrated in the following diagrams.
Note:  Some of these Attributes relate the image data to manufacturer specific characteristics of the detector that may be used for quality control purposes, e.g. correlation of image artifacts with a detector defect map, analysis of noise performance, etc.

The Displayed Area is defined in pixel coordinates relative to the stored image pixel values by the Attributes of the Display Shutter Module (see section C.7.6.11). If this Module is not present or supported, then the Displayed Area is equal to the Field of View.
The Exposed Area is defined in pixel coordinates relative to the stored image pixel values by the Attributes of the X-Ray Collimator Module (see section C.8.7.3).
For the Digital X-Ray IODs, the Field of View is usually rectangular in shape and the same size as the stored Pixel Data (7FE0,0010). The shape and size of the Field of View and the spacing of the pixels are defined by the following Attributes:
- Field of View Shape (0018,1147),
- Field of View Dimensions (0018,1149),
- Imager Pixel Spacing (0018,1164),
- Rows (0028,0010),
- Columns (0028,0011)

The following Attributes define the relationship of the Field of View to the Physical Detector Area:
- Field of View Origin (0018,7030),
- Field of View Rotation (0018,7032),
- Field of View Horizontal Flip (0018,7034).

For the Digital X-Ray IODs, the Active Area, i.e. that part of the detector matrix that was activated for this exposure, is usually rectangular in shape. The shape and size of the Active Area and the size and spacing of the detectors are defined by the following Attributes:
- Detector Active Shape (0018,7024),
- Detector Active Dimensions (0018,7026),
- Detector Element Physical Size (0018,7020),
- Detector Element Spacing (0018,7022).

Notes:  1. The Detector Element Physical Size (0018,7020) and Detector Element Spacing (0018,7022) may be different if there are insensitive regions between each detector.
  2. This model of description is not able to accurately describe multiple matrices of detectors that are “tiled” to produce a single image.

The following optional Attribute defines the relationship of the Active Area to the Physical Detector Area:
- Detector Active Origin (0018,7028).

The relationship between detectors and stored image pixels is defined by Detector Binning (0018,701A) which specifies how many detectors, in each of the row and column directions, contribute to (are pooled or averaged to form) a single stored image pixel.
Note:  Detector Binning (0018,701A) may have values less than one if sub-sampling is used to derive an image with higher spatial resolution than the detector matrix.

      <section ref="C.8.7.5.1.2" name="">The definitions of Positioner Angles shall be with respect to the patient as illustrated in Figures C.8-11 and C.8-12 Zero degree is referenced to the origin perpendicular to the patient's chest. The Positioner Primary Angle definition is like longitude (in the equatorial plan); the Positioner Secondary Angle definition is like latitude (in the sagittal plane). The Positioner Angle attributes apply to the first frame of a multi-frame image. The valid range of Primary Positioner Angle is -180 to +180 degrees and the Secondary Positioner Angle range is -90 to + 90 degrees.
The Patient Plane is defined by the isocenter of the imaging device and slices through the patient such that it is perpendicular to the sagittal plane of the body. The Primary Axis of rotation is defined at the intersection of the Patient Plane and of the Sagittal Plane. The Positioner Primary Angle is defined in the transaxial plane at the isocenter with zero degrees in the direction perpendicular to the patient's chest and + 90 degrees at the Patient left hand side (LAO) and -90 at the Patient right hand side (RAO). The valid range of Primary Positioner Angle is -180 to +180 degrees.
The Secondary Axis is in the Patient Plane and is perpendicular to the Primary Axis at the isocenter. The Positioner Secondary Angle is defined in the Sagittal Plane at the isocenter with zero degrees in the direction perpendicular to the patient's chest. +90 degrees corresponds to the cranial direction. The Secondary Positioner Angle range is -90 to + 90 degrees.
At a 0 angle for both the Primary Angle (0018,1510) and Secondary Angle (0018,1511), the patient faces the Image Intensifier.
The Positioner Primary Angle (0018,1510) and Secondary Angle (0018,1511) apply to the first frame of a multi-frame image.

      <section ref="C.10.5.1.1" name="">The text shall be displayed if any part of the bounding box or anchor point is within the Specified Display Area.
The text need not be confined to within the bounding box, but shall be rendered in a direction from the Top Left Hand Corner (TLHC) of the bounding box to the Bottom Right Hand Corner (BRHC) of the bounding box, even if these coordinates have been specified in an image relative space and then transformed (rotated, flipped or scaled).
Notes:  1. An implementation may render text outside the confines of the bounding box if necessary to display all the specified text.
  2. Alternatively, an implementation may choose to render the text in a scrolling box, or a link to another fixed or popup window as appropriate.

Whether the contents of the bounding box completely opacify the underlying image or whether the box is “transparent” is undefined.
Notes:  1. For example, an implementation may choose an “exclusive or” style opacification to be sure that the text is discernible over light and dark portions of the image.
  2. Commonly, the region of the bounding box around the text will be rendered “transparently”, i.e. the image will be visible, though some implementations may choose to opacify the bounding box behind the text to improve its readability.

An alternative to specifying a bounding box, is to specify an Anchor Point (0070,0014), i.e. some point in an image or Specified Displayed Area that is related to the text. The semantics of this relationship, and the manner of positioning or linking the text to this point, are unspecified.
Notes:  1. For example, a description of a feature may be linked to a point in the image, and when that image is displayed, if it is magnified and panned, the rendered text (and any arrow or line drawn in response to Anchor Point Visibility (0070,0015)) might be repositioned as appropriate so as not to be cropped out of the Specified Displayed Area.
  2. As another example, the text could be rendered in a pop-up window when a hypertext link flagged on the displayed image at the location of the Anchor Point (0070,0014) is selected.
  3. The bounding box and anchor point need not be defined with the same axis units, i.e. one can be image pixel relative, and the other displayed area relative.

The size, font and rotation of the individual rendered text characters are unspecified.

      <section ref="C.10.9.1.4.1" name="">Channel Source Sequence (003A,0208) identifies the metric (quality being measured, e.g., voltage or pressure), the anatomical position of the sensor or probe, the function of the channel (e.g., measurement or stimulus), and any particulars of technique which affect those parameters (e.g., pull-back across multiple anatomic sites, or differential input from two distinct sites). If the full semantics of the source is not carried in a single coded entry (e.g., if it specifies the location but not the metric), additional qualifiers are identified in Channel Source Modifiers Sequence (003A,0209) coded entries.
When a single sensor channel is used to collect a waveform from two (or more) anatomic sites, e.g., in hemodynamic pull-back procedures, multiple Channel Source Modifier items will identify the sequence of sites, if not encoded in the semantics of the Channel Source Coded Entry. Transition times from one site to another may be indicated with an Annotation, or pull-back rate may be indicated with an Acquisition Context Sequence Item (see Section C.7.6.14).
The Baseline (default) Context IDs are defined by IOD in accordance with Section A.34. Restrictions in the IOD may also determine the pattern of specification of the waveform source, i.e., which item is to be encoded in the Channel Source sequence, and the order in which Channel Source Modifier items are to be encoded.

      <section ref="C.10.10.1.1" name="">Referenced Waveform Channels (0040,A0B0) is a multi-value attribute which lists the channels to which an annotation of a waveform applies. Each channel is specified as a pair of values (M,C), where the first value is the ordinal of the sequence item of the Waveform Sequence (5400,0100) attribute (i.e., the Multiplex Group Number), and the second value is the ordinal of the sequence item of the Channel Definition Sequence (003A,0200) attribute (i.e., the Waveform Channel Number) within the multiplex group.
If the specified channel number is 0, the annotation applies to all channels in the multiplex group.
Note:  As an example, an annotation which applies to the entire first multiplex group and channels 2 and 3 of the third multiplex group would have Referenced Channels value 0001 0000 0003 0002 0003 0003.

      <description>Specifies the format of the LUT Data in this Sequence.
See C.11.2.1.1 for further explanation.</description>
      <section ref="C.11.2.1.1" name="">The three values of the LUT Descriptor (0028,3002) describe the format of the LUT Data in the corresponding Data Element (0028,3006).
The first value is the number of entries in the lookup table. When the number of table entries is equal to 216 then this value shall be 0.
The second value is the first input value mapped. The Value Representation of the second value (US or SS) depends on the source of the input to the VOI LUT, and shall be:
- the same as specified by Pixel Representation (0028,0103), if there is no Modality LUT or Rescale Slope and Intercept specified;
- SS if the possible output range after application of the Rescale Slope and Intercept may be signed;
Note:  This is always the case for the CT Image IOD in which the Rescale Type is specified to be Hounsfield Units, which are always signed.
- US otherwise.

This input value is mapped to the first entry in the LUT. All input values less than the first value mapped are also mapped to the first entry in the LUT Data. An input value one greater than the first value mapped is mapped to the second entry in the LUT Data. Subsequent input values are mapped to the subsequent entries in the LUT Data up to an input value equal to number of entries + first value mapped - 1 which is mapped to the last entry in the LUT Data. Input values greater than or equal to number of entries + first value mapped are also mapped to the last entry in the LUT Data.
The third value specifies the number of bits for each entry in the LUT Data. If the VOI LUT is included in an Image IOD, the third value of LUT Descriptor (0028,3002) shall be 8 or 16 bits, unless otherwise specialized. If the VOI LUT is included in a Presentation State IOD, the third value of LUT Descriptor (0028,3002) shall be between 8 and 16 inclusive. The LUT Data shall be stored in a format equivalent to 8 bits allocated when the number of bits for each entry is 8, and 16 bits allocated when the number of bits for each entry is 16, where in both cases the high bit is equal to bits stored - 1, and where bits stored is the third value.
Notes:  1. Since the LUT Descriptor (0028,3002) Attribute is multi-valued, in an Explicit VR Transfer Syntax, only one value representation (US or SS) may be specified, even though the first and third values are always by definition interpreted as unsigned. The explicit VR actually used is dictated by the VR needed to represent the second value.
  2. Some implementations have encoded 8 bit entries with 16 bits allocated, padding the high bits; this can be detected by comparing the number of entries specified in the LUT Descriptor with the actual value length of the LUT Data entry. The value length in bytes should equal the number of entries if bits allocated is 8, and be twice as long if bits allocated is 16.

The LUT Data contains the LUT entry values.
The output range is from 0 to 2n-1 where n is the third value of LUT Descriptor. This range is always unsigned.

      <section ref="C.11.2.1.2" name="">Window Center (0028,1050) and Window Width (0028,1051) specify a linear conversion from stored pixel values (after any Modality LUT or Rescale Slope and Intercept specified in the IOD have been applied) to values to be displayed. Window Center contains the input value that is the center of the window. Window Width contains the width of the window.
Note:  The terms “window center” and “window width” are not consistently used in practice, nor were they defined in previous versions of the standard. The definitions here are presented for the purpose of defining consistent meanings for identity and threshold transformations while preserving the common practice of using integral values for center and width.

Window Width (0028,1051) shall always be greater than or equal to 1.
When Window Width (0028,1051) is greater than 1, these Attributes select the range of input values that are to be mapped to the full range of the displayed output.
When Window Width (0028,1051) is equal to 1, they specify a threshold below which input values will be displayed as the minimum output value.
Note:  Whether the minimum output value is rendered as black or white may depend on the value of Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) or the presence of a Presentation LUT Module.

These Attributes are applied according to the following pseudo-code, where x is the input value, y is an output value with a range from ymin to ymax, c is Window Center (0028,1050) and w is Window Width (0028,1051):
    if  (x &lt;= c - 0.5 - (w-1)/2), then y = ymin
    else if  (x &gt; c - 0.5 + (w-1)/2), then y = ymax,
    else  y = ((x - (c - 0.5)) / (w-1) + 0.5) * (ymax - ymin)+ ymin

Notes:  1. For the purpose of this definition, a floating point calculation without integer truncation is assumed, though the manner of implementation may vary as long as the result is the same.
  2. The pseudo-code function computes a continuous value over the output range without any discontinuity at the boundaries. The value of 0 for w is expressly forbidden, and the value of 1 for w does not cause division by zero, since the continuous segment of the function will never be reached for that case.
  3. For example, for an output range 0 to 255:
    c=2048, w=4096 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= 0) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; 4095) then y = 255
      else y = ((x - 2047.5) / 4095 + 0.5) * (255-0) + 0
    c=2048, w=1 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= 2047.5) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; 2047.5) then y = 255
      else /* not reached */

    c=0, w=100 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= -50) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; 49) then y = 255
      else y = ((x + 0.5) / 99 + 0.5) * (255-0) + 0
    c=0, w=1 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= -0.5) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; -0.5) then y = 255
      else /* not reached */

  4. A Window Center of 2n-1 and a Window Width of 2n selects the range of input values from 0 to 2n-1. This represents an identity VOI LUT transformation in the case where no Modality LUT is specified and the stored pixel data are n bit unsigned integers.
  5. A Window Width of 1 is typically used to represent a "threshold" operation in which those integer input values less than the Window Center are represented as the minimum displayed value and those greater than or equal to the Window Center are represented as the maximum displayed value. A Window Width of 2 will have the same result for integral input values.
  6. The application of Window Center (0028,1050) and Window Width (0028,1051) may select a signed input range. There is no implication that this signed input range is clipped to zero.
  7. The selected input range may exceed the actual range of the input values, thus effectively “compressing” the contrast range of the displayed data into a narrower band of the available contrast range, and “flattening” the appearance. There are no limits to the maximum value of the window width, or to the minimum or maximum value of window level, both of which may exceed the actual or possible range of input values.
  8. Input values "below" the window are displayed as the minimum output value and input values "above" the window are displayed as the maximum output value. This is the common usage of the window operation in medical imaging. There is no provision for an alternative approach in which all values "outside" the window are displayed as the minimum output value.
  9. The output of the Window Center/Width or VOI LUT transformation is either implicitly scaled to the full range of the display device if there is no succeeding transformation defined, or implicitly scaled to the full input range of the succeeding transformation step (such as the Presentation LUT), if present. See C.11.6.1.
  10. Fractional values of Window Center and Window Width are permitted (since the VR of these Attributes is Decimal String), and though they are not often encountered, applications should be prepared to accept them.

These Attributes shall be used only for Images with Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) values of MONOCHROME1 and MONOCHROME2. They have no meaning for other Images.
If multiple values are present, both Attributes shall have the same number of values and shall be considered as pairs. Multiple values indicate that multiple alternative views may be presented.
If any VOI LUT Table is included by an Image, a Window Width and Window Center or the VOI LUT Table, but not both, may be applied to the Image for display. Inclusion of both indicates that multiple alternative views may be presented.
If multiple items are present in VOI LUT Sequence (0028,3010), only one may be applied to the Image for display. Multiple items indicate that multiple alternative views may be presented.
If the VOI LUT Module is defined in an IOD and if neither a VOI LUT Sequence nor a Window Width and Window Center are present, then the VOI LUT stage of the grayscale pipeline is defined to be an identity transformation.
Notes:  1. This requirement is specified so that IODs that define a particular output space for the grayscale pipeline, such as P-Values, are not in an undefined state when no VOI LUT Sequence or Window Width and Window Center are present.
  2. Despite the Type 3 requirement for VOI LUT Sequence and Window Center, implementations that render images are expected to implement and apply these transformations when they are present in the image, unless overridden by the user, a presentation state, or a hanging protocol, and to allow the user to select which transformation to apply when multiple transformations are present.

      <description>Window Width for display. See C.11.2.1.2 for further explanation.
Required if Window Center (0028,1050) is sent.</description>
      <section ref="C.11.2.1.2" name="">Window Center (0028,1050) and Window Width (0028,1051) specify a linear conversion from stored pixel values (after any Modality LUT or Rescale Slope and Intercept specified in the IOD have been applied) to values to be displayed. Window Center contains the input value that is the center of the window. Window Width contains the width of the window.
Note:  The terms “window center” and “window width” are not consistently used in practice, nor were they defined in previous versions of the standard. The definitions here are presented for the purpose of defining consistent meanings for identity and threshold transformations while preserving the common practice of using integral values for center and width.

Window Width (0028,1051) shall always be greater than or equal to 1.
When Window Width (0028,1051) is greater than 1, these Attributes select the range of input values that are to be mapped to the full range of the displayed output.
When Window Width (0028,1051) is equal to 1, they specify a threshold below which input values will be displayed as the minimum output value.
Note:  Whether the minimum output value is rendered as black or white may depend on the value of Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) or the presence of a Presentation LUT Module.

These Attributes are applied according to the following pseudo-code, where x is the input value, y is an output value with a range from ymin to ymax, c is Window Center (0028,1050) and w is Window Width (0028,1051):
    if  (x &lt;= c - 0.5 - (w-1)/2), then y = ymin
    else if  (x &gt; c - 0.5 + (w-1)/2), then y = ymax,
    else  y = ((x - (c - 0.5)) / (w-1) + 0.5) * (ymax - ymin)+ ymin

Notes:  1. For the purpose of this definition, a floating point calculation without integer truncation is assumed, though the manner of implementation may vary as long as the result is the same.
  2. The pseudo-code function computes a continuous value over the output range without any discontinuity at the boundaries. The value of 0 for w is expressly forbidden, and the value of 1 for w does not cause division by zero, since the continuous segment of the function will never be reached for that case.
  3. For example, for an output range 0 to 255:
    c=2048, w=4096 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= 0) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; 4095) then y = 255
      else y = ((x - 2047.5) / 4095 + 0.5) * (255-0) + 0
    c=2048, w=1 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= 2047.5) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; 2047.5) then y = 255
      else /* not reached */

    c=0, w=100 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= -50) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; 49) then y = 255
      else y = ((x + 0.5) / 99 + 0.5) * (255-0) + 0
    c=0, w=1 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= -0.5) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; -0.5) then y = 255
      else /* not reached */

The first value is the number of entries in the lookup table. When the number of table entries is equal to 216 then this value shall be 0. The number of entries shall be equal to the number of possible values in the input. (For 8 bit input will be 256 entries, for 12 bit input it will be 4096 entries)
The second value is the first input value mapped, and shall always be 0. The Value Representation of the second value is always US. This input value is mapped to the first entry in the LUT. Subsequent input values are mapped to the subsequent entries in the LUT Data up to an input value equal to number of entries + first value mapped - 1 which is mapped to the last entry in the LUT Data. There are no input values greater than number of entries – 1.
The third value specifies the number of bits for each entry in the LUT Data. It shall be between 10 and 16 inclusive. The LUT Data shall be stored in a format equivalent to 16 bits allocated where the high bit is equal to bits stored - 1, where bits stored is the third value.
Note:  Since the LUT Descriptor (0028,3002) Attribute is multi-valued, in an Explicit VR Transfer Syntax, only one value representation (US or SS) may be specified. Since all three values are always by definition interpreted as unsigned, the explicit VR actually used will always be US.

LUT Data (0028,3006) contains the LUT entry values, which are P-Values.
The output range is from 0 to 2n-1 where n is the third value of LUT Descriptor. This range is always unsigned.
This range specifies the output range of the P-Values.

      <section ref="C.11.6.1.1" name="">The three values of the LUT Descriptor (0028,3002) describe the format of the LUT Data in the corresponding Data Element (0028,3006).
The first value is the number of entries in the lookup table. When the number of table entries is equal to 216 then this value shall be 0.
The second value is the first implicitly scaled input value mapped, and shall always be 0. The Value Representation of the second value is always US. This implicitly scaled input value is mapped to the first entry in the LUT. There are no implicitly scaled input values less than the first value mapped. An implicitly scaled input value one greater than the first value mapped is mapped to the second entry in the LUT Data. Subsequent implicitly scaled input values are mapped to the subsequent entries in the LUT Data up to an implicitly scaled input value equal to number of entries + first value mapped - 1 which is mapped to the last entry in the LUT Data. There are no implicitly scaled input values greater than number of entries + first value mapped.
The third value specifies the number of bits for each entry in the LUT Data. The third value of the LUT Descriptor (0028,3002) shall be between 8 and 16 inclusive. The LUT Data shall be stored in a format equivalent to 8 bits allocated when the number of bits for each entry is 8, and 16 bits allocated when the number of bits for each entry is 16, where the high bit is equal to bits stored - 1, and where bits stored is the third value.
Notes:  1. Since the LUT Descriptor (0028,3002) Attribute is multi-valued, in an Explicit VR Transfer Syntax, only one value representation (US or SS) may be specified. Since all three values are always by definition interpreted as unsigned, the explicit VR actually used will always be US.
  2. Some implementations have encoded 8 bit entries with 16 bits allocated, padding the high bits; this can be detected by comparing the number of entries specified in the LUT Descriptor with the actual value length of the LUT Data entry. The value length in bytes should equal the number of entries if bits allocated is 8, and be twice as long if bits allocated is 16.

The LUT Data contains the LUT entry values, which are P-Values.
The output range is from 0 to 2n-1 where n is the third value of LUT Descriptor. This range is always unsigned.
This range specifies the output range of the P-Values.

      <description>A Sequence of exactly two Items, one identifying and describing transformations upon a set of underlying grayscale images, and the other identifying and describing transformations upon a set of superimposed grayscale images. See C.11.14.1.1.</description>
      <section ref="C.11.14.1.1" name="">The Blending Sequence (0070,0402) Attribute is used to identify two sets of images, one to be superimposed upon the other.
The sets of images and any subset of the frames therein in the case of multi-frame images are identified by Study, Series, SOP Instance and Frame Number.
This module specifies no explicit relationship (such as pairing or ordering) between the sets of images and frames defined in the first item for the underlying images, and the second item for the superimposed images. This module does not define how the images are spatially related, and what re-sampling, if any, needs to be performed before the images are blended for rendering.
Note:  The images in the two sets may share the same Frame of Reference, in which case the rendering application can spatially relate the two sets of images based on their Image Position (Patient) (0020,0032) and Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037) Attributes.
  Alternatively, a Spatial Registration SOP Instance may exist that relates either two different Frames of Reference, or two sets of images identified by UID and frame.
  Whilst the two sets of images may already be spatially co-registered and oriented in the same plane, or even be sampled at the same in-plane and between-plane resolution, this will frequently not be the case.
  See PS 3.4 for behavioral requirements that apply to Storage SOP Classes using this Module.

If the Attribute Specific Character Set (0008,0005) is not present or has only a single value, Code Extension techniques are not used. Defined terms for the Attribute Specific Character Set (0008,0005), when single valued, are derived from the International Registration Number as per ISO 2375 (e.g., ISO_IR 100 for Latin alphabet No. 1). See Table C.12-2.

Note:  To use the single-byte code table of JIS X0201, the value of attribute Specific Character Set (0008,0005), value 1 should be ISO_IR 13. This means that ISO-IR 13 is designated as the G1 code element which is invoked in the GR area. It should be understood that, in addition, ISO-IR 14 is designated as the G0 code element and this is invoked in the GL area.

If the attribute Specific Character Set (0008,0005) has more than one value, Code Extension techniques are used and Escape Sequences may be encountered in all character sets. Requirements for the use of Code Extension techniques are specified in PS 3.5. In order to indicate the presence of Code Extension, the Defined Terms for the repertoires have the prefix “ISO 2022”, e.g., ISO 2022 IR 100 for the Latin Alphabet No. 1. See Table 12-3 and Table 12-4. Table 12-3 describes single-byte character sets for value 1 to value n of the attribute Specific Character Set (0008,0005), and Table 12-4 describes multi-byte character sets for value 2 to value n of the attribute Specific Character Set (0008,0005).
Note:  A prefix other than “ISO 2022” may be needed in the future if other Code Extension techniques are adopted.

There are multi-byte character sets that prohibit the use of Code Extension Techniques. The Unicode character set used in ISO 10646, when encoded in UTF-8, and the GB18030 character set, encoded per the rules of GB18030, both prohibit the use of Code Extension Techniques. These character sets may only be specified as value 1 in the Specific Character Set (0008,0005) attribute and there shall only be one value. The minimal length UTF-8 encoding shall always be used for ISO 10646.
Notes:  1. The ISO standards for 10646 now prohibit the use of anything but the minimum length encoding for UTF-8. UTF-8 permits multiple different encodings, but when used to encode Unicode characters in accordance with ISO 10646-1 and 10646-2 (with extensions) only the minimal encodings are legal.
  2. The representation for the characters in the DICOM Default Character Repertoire is the same single byte value for the Default Character Repertoire, ISO 10646 in UTF-8, and GB18030. It is also the 7-bit US-ASCII encoding.

      <section ref="C.12.1.1.4.2" name="">The Encrypted Content (0400,0520) Attribute contains an Enveloped-data content type of the cryptographic message syntax defined in RFC 2630. The encrypted content of the Enveloped-data content type is an instance of the Encrypted Attributes Data Set as shown in Table C.12-7 (i.e., it is a Sequence with a single Item), encoded with the Transfer Syntax specified by the Encrypted Content Transfer Syntax UID (0400,0510) Attribute. Figure C.12-2 shows an example of how the Encrypted Content is encoded. The exact use of this Data Set is defined in the Attribute Confidentiality Profiles in PS 3.15.
Since the de-identified SOP Instance is a significantly altered version of the original Data Set, it is a new SOP Instance, with a SOP Instance UID that differs from the original Data Set.
Note:  1. Content encryption may require that the content (the DICOM Data Set) be padded to a multiple of some block size. This shall be performed according to the Content-encryption Process defined in RFC-2630.
  2. Any standard or private Transfer Syntax may be specified in Encrypted Content Transfer Syntax UID (0400,0510) unless encoding is performed in accordance with an Attribute Confidentiality Profile that specifies additional restrictions. In general, an application entity decoding the Encrypted Attributes Sequence may not assume any particular Transfer Syntax or set of Transfer Syntaxes to be used with Encrypted Content Transfer Syntax UID (0400,0510).
  3. For certain applications it might be necessary to “blacken” (remove) identifying information that is burned in to the image pixel data. The Encrypted Attributes Data Set does not specify a means of restoring the original image information without the complete image pixel data being encoded inside the Modified Attributes Sequence (0400,0550). If access to the original, unmodified pixel data is required and the image pixel data cannot be replicated inside the Modified Attributes Sequence (0400,0550) due to resource considerations, the SOP Instance UID may be used to locate the original SOP Instance from which the de-identified version was derived.
  4. There is no guarantee that the original SOP Instance can be reconstructed from the data in Encrypted Content. If access to the original data is required, the (de-encrypted) UIDs may be used to locate the original SOP Instance from which the de-identified version was derived.

      <section ref="C.12.1.1.6" name="">The HL7 Structured Document Reference Sequence (0040,A390) identifies instances of Structured Documents defined under an HL7 standard. The HL7 standards that define such documents include the Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) and Structured Product Labeling (SPL) standards.
References to HL7 Structured Documents from within DICOM SOP Instances shall be encoded with a SOP Class UID and SOP Instance UID pair. The Abstract Syntax of an HL7 Structured Document is defined by its Hierarchical Message Description; the Object Identifier of the Hierarchical Message Description shall be used as the SOP Class UID for the Structured Document reference.
Notes:  1. The Hierarchical Message Description Object Identifiers are specified in the HL7 OID Registry (http://hl7.org/oid). The HL7 OIDs for these types of documents are:
  CDA Release 1    2.16.840.1.113883.1.7.1
  CDA Release 2    2.16.840.1.113883.1.7.2
  SPL Release 1    2.16.840.1.113883.1.7.3
  2. The Hierarchical Message Description Object Identifiers do not imply a network or media storage service, as do SOP Class UIDs. However, they do identify the Abstract Syntax, similar to SOP Class UIDs.

The HL7 Structured Document instances are natively identified by an attribute using the Instance Identifier (II) Data Type, as defined in HL7 v3 Data Types - Abstract Specification. A UID as defined by the DICOM UI Value Representation is a valid identifier under the II Data Type; however, an II attribute is not always encodable as a UID. Therefore a UID shall be constructed for use within the DICOM Data Set that can be mapped to the native instance identifier encoded as an HL7 II Data Type. This mapping is performed through the combination of the local Referenced SOP Instance UID (0008,1155) and the HL7 Instance Identifier (0040,E001) attributes in the HL7 Structured Document Reference Sequence (0040,A390).
Notes:  1. An HL7 II is not encodable as a UID if it exceeds 64 characters, or if it includes an extension. See HL7 v3 DT R1.
  2. Even though an II may contain just a UID, applications should take care to use the II specified in HL7 Instance Identifier (0040,E001) to access the Structured Document. If the instance identifier used natively within the referenced document is encodable using the UI VR, i.e., it is an ISO 8824 OID up to 64 characters without an extension, it is recommended to be used as the Referenced SOP Instance UID within the current Instance.
  3. The Referenced SOP Instance UID used to reference a particular HL7 Structured Document is not necessarily the same in all DICOM Instances. For example, two SR Documents may internally use different SOP Instance UIDs to reference the same HL7 Structured Document, but they will each contain a mapping to the same HL7 Instance Identifier as the external identifier.
  4. The HL7 Instance Identifier is encoded in attribute (0040,E001) as a serialization of the UID and Extension (if any) separated by a caret character. This is the same format adopted in the IHE Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing (XDS) profile (see http://www.ihe.net).

      <section ref="C.12.1.1.3.1.2" name="">To generate the MAC, Data Elements referenced either explicitly or implicitly by the Tags in the Data Elements Signed list shall be encoded using the Transfer Syntax identified by the MAC Calculation Transfer Syntax UID (0400,0010) of the MAC Parameters Sequence item where the Data Elements Signed Attribute appears. Data shall be formed into a byte stream and presented to the MAC Algorithm for computation of the MAC according to the following rules:
For all Data Elements except those with a VR of SQ or with a VR of OB with an undefined length, all Data Element fields, including the Tag, the VR, the reserved field (if any), the Value Length, and the Value, shall be placed into the byte stream in the order encountered.
For Data Elements with a VR of SQ or with a VR of OB with an undefined length, the Tag, the VR, and the reserved field are placed into the byte stream. The Value Length shall not be included. This is followed by each Item Tag in the order encountered, without including the Value Length, followed by the contents of the Value for that item. In the case of an Item within a Data Element whose VR is SQ, these rules are applied recursively to all of the Data Elements within the Value of that Item. After all the Items have been incorporate into the byte stream, a Sequence Delimitation Item Tag (FFFE,E0DD) shall be added to the byte stream presented to the MAC Algorithm, regardless of whether or not it was originally present.
Note:  Since the Value Length of Data Elements with a VR of SQ can be either explicit or undefined, the Value Lengths of such Data Elements are left out of the MAC calculation. Similarly, the Value Length of Data Elements with a VR of OB with an undefined length are also left out so that they are handled consistently. If such Data Elements do come with undefined lengths, including the Item Tags that separate the Items or fragments insures that Data Elements cannot be moved between Items or Fragments without compromising the Digital Signature. For those Data Elements with explicit lengths, if the length of an item changes, the added or removed portions would also impact the MAC calculation, so it is not necessary to include explicit lengths in the MAC calculation. It is possible that including the Value Lengths could make cryptoanalysis easier.

After the fields of all the Data Elements in the Data Elements Signed list have been placed into the byte stream presented to the MAC Algorithm according to the above rules, all of the Data Elements within the Digital Signatures Sequence item except the Certificate of Signer (0400,0115), Signature (0400,0120), Certified Timestamp Type (0400,0305), and Certified Timestamp (0400,0310) shall also be encoded according to the above rules, and presented to the MAC algorithm (i.e., the Attributes of the Digital Signature Sequence Item for this particular Digital Signature are also implicitly included in the list of Data Elements Signed, except as noted above).
The resulting MAC code after processing this byte stream by the MAC Algorithm is then encrypted as specified in the Certificate of Signer and placed in the Value of the Signature Data Element.
Notes:  1. The Transfer Syntax used in the MAC calculation may differ from the Transfer Syntax used to exchange the Data Set.
  2. Digital Signatures require explicit VR in order to calculate the MAC. An Application Entity which receives a Data Set with an implicit VR Transfer Syntax may not be able to verify Digital Signatures that include Private Data Elements or Data Elements unknown to that Application Entity.This also true of any Data Elements whose VR is UN. Without knowledge of the Value Representation, the receiving Application Entity would be unable to perform proper byte swapping or be able to properly parse sequences in order to generate a MAC.
  3. If more than one entity signs, each Digital Signature would appear in its own Digital Signatures Sequence item. The Digital Signatures may or may not share the same MAC Parameters Sequence item.
4. The notion of a notary public (i.e., someone who verifies the identity of the signer) for Digital Signatures is partially filled by the authority that issued the Certificate of Signer.

The Identical Documents Sequence Attribute in each SOP Instance shall contain references to all other duplicate SOP Instances.
Note: If an SR Document contains an Identical Documents Sequence then it will not be further duplicated without producing a new complete set of duplicate SOP Instances with re-generated Identical Documents Sequences. This is a consequence of the rules for modification of SR Document content in PS3.4. For example, if there are two identical reports and an application is creating a third identical report, then the first two reports must be re-generated in order that their Identical Documents Sequence will reference the new duplicate document and all other identical documents.

If a new SR Document is created using content from an SR Document that contains an Identical Documents Sequence and is part of the same Requested Procedure, then the new SR Document shall only contain a new Identical Documents Sequence if the new SR Document is duplicated. The Predecessor Documents Sequence in all the new SR Documents shall contain references to the original SR Document and all its duplicates as well as any other documents from which content is included.
Note:  It is up to an implementation to decide whether a new SR Document is duplicated across multiple Studies. This may require user input to make the decision.

      <section ref="C.17.2.2" name="">If identical copies of an SR Document are to be included in multiple Studies then the entire SR Document shall be duplicated with appropriate changes for inclusion into the different Studies (i.e. Study Instance UID, Series Instance UID, SOP Instance UID, Identical Documents Sequence etc.). The Identical Documents Sequence Attribute in each SOP Instance shall contain references to all other duplicate SOP Instances.
Note: If an SR Document contains an Identical Documents Sequence then it will not be further duplicated without producing a new complete set of duplicate SOP Instances with re-generated Identical Documents Sequences. This is a consequence of the rules for modification of SR Document content in PS3.4. For example, if there are two identical reports and an application is creating a third identical report, then the first two reports must be re-generated in order that their Identical Documents Sequence will reference the new duplicate document and all other identical documents.

If a new SR Document is created using content from an SR Document that contains an Identical Documents Sequence and is part of the same Requested Procedure, then the new SR Document shall only contain a new Identical Documents Sequence if the new SR Document is duplicated. The Predecessor Documents Sequence in all the new SR Documents shall contain references to the original SR Document and all its duplicates as well as any other documents from which content is included.
Note:  It is up to an implementation to decide whether a new SR Document is duplicated across multiple Studies. This may require user input to make the decision.

Registration often involves two or more RCS, each with a corresponding Frame of Reference Transformation Matrix. For example, another Frame of Reference Transformation Matrix AMC can describe how to transform a point (Cx,Cy,Cz) with respect to RCSC into (Ax,Ay,Az) with respect to RCSA. It is straightforward to find the Frame of Reference Transformation Matrix BMC that describes how to transform the point (Cx,Cy,Cz) with respect to RCSC into the point (Bx,By,Bz) with respect to RCSB. The solution is to invert AMB and multiply by AMC, as shown below:

      <section ref="C.20.2.1.2" name="">There are three types of Registration Matrices:
RIGID: This is a registration involving only translations and rotations. Mathematically, the matrix is constrained to be orthonormal and describes six degrees of freedom: three translations, and three rotations.
RIGID_SCALE: This is a registration involving only translations, rotations and scaling. Mathematically, the matrix is constrained to be orthogonal and describes nine degrees of freedom: three translations, three rotations and three scales. This type of transformation is sometimes used in atlas mapping.
AFFINE: This is a registration involving translations, rotations, scaling and shearing. Mathematically, there are no constraints on the elements of the Frame of Reference Transformation Matrix, so it conveys twelve degrees of freedom. This type of transformation is sometimes used in atlas mapping.

      <section ref="C.20.3.1.1" name="">The registrations in this module are applied to the Registered RCS coordinates in the following order. First, transform the coordinates using the matrix described in the Pre Deformation Matrix Registration Sequence (0064,000F). Next apply the deformation offsets to the resulting coordinates. Finally, transform those coordinates using the matrix described in the Post Deformation Matrix Registration Sequence (0064,0010).

Thus a source coordinate may be calculated using the following equation:

Registration often involves two or more RCS, each with a corresponding Frame of Reference Transformation Matrix. For example, another Frame of Reference Transformation Matrix AMC can describe how to transform a point (Cx,Cy,Cz) with respect to RCSC into (Ax,Ay,Az) with respect to RCSA. It is straightforward to find the Frame of Reference Transformation Matrix BMC that describes how to transform the point (Cx,Cy,Cz) with respect to RCSC into the point (Bx,By,Bz) with respect to RCSB. The solution is to invert AMB and multiply by AMC, as shown below:

Each series shall have a single Frame of Reference UID. However, multiple Series within a Study may share a Frame of Reference UID. All images in a Series that share the same Frame of Reference UID shall be spatially related to each other.
Notes:  1. Previous versions of this Standard defined a Data Element "Location", which has been retired. Frame of Reference UID provides a completely unambiguous identification of the image location reference used to indicate position.
  2. A common Frame of Reference UID may be used to spatially relate localizer images with a set of transverse images. However, in some cases (eg. multiple localizer images being related to a single set of transverse images) a common Frame of Reference UID may not be sufficient. The Referenced Image Sequence (0008,1140) provides an unambiguous method for relating localizer images.

      <section ref="C.21.2.1.1" name="">For convenient registration, correlated Fiducials exist in each image set of the Registration Sequence. Correlated Fiducials are identified with either Fiducial Identifier (0070,0310) or Fiducial Identifier Code Sequence (0070,0311).

Shape Type (0070,0306) defines the geometric interpretation of the Contour Data (3006,0050) and Graphic Data (0070,0022). A point is defined as a triplet (x,y,z) in the case of spatial data or a pair (x,y) in the case of graphic data.
Defined Terms are:
POINT = a single point designating a single fiducial point.
Note: A point may be the epicenter of a more complex shape such as sphere.
LINE = two points that specify a line or axis such as the inter-orbital line. The point locations have no significance other than identifying the line, i.e. they are not line segment end points.
PLANE = three points that identify a plane such as the laterality plane
SURFACE = three or more points (usually many) that reside on, or near, a region of a curved surface. The surface may be flat or curved, closed or open. The point order has no significance.
RULER = two or more evenly spaced collinear points ordered sequentially along the line, such as a physical ruler placed in the imaging field.
L_SHAPE = three points of two perpendicular line segments, AB and BC, having a common end point B. The order of the points is: ABC. May represent an L-shaped marker placed in the imaging field.
T_SHAPE = three points of two perpendicular line segments AB and CD, such that C bisects AB. The order is ABD.
SHAPE = three or more points that specify the shape of a well-known fiducial type. The term in the Fiducial Identifier Code Sequence (0070,0311) defines the shape and the order of the points that represent it.

The Value Representation of all components of the N-tuple shall be the same. The image or Specified Displayed Area relative drawing space is defined in Graphic Annotation Units (0070,0005).
If Graphic Type (0070,0023) is POINT, then two values (one point) shall be specified and the single point specified is to be drawn.
If Graphic Type (0070,0023) is POLYLINE, then the points are to be interpreted as an n-tuple list of end points between which straight lines are to be drawn.
If Graphic Type (0070,0023) is INTERPOLATED, then the points are to be interpreted as an n-tuple list of end points between which some form of implementation dependent curved lines are to be drawn. The rendered line shall pass through all the specified points.
If Graphic Type (0070,0023) is CIRCLE, then exactly two points shall be present; the first point is to be interpreted as the center and the second point as a point on the circumference of a circle, some form of implementation dependent representation of which is to be drawn.
If Graphic Type (0070,0023) is ELLIPSE, then exactly four points shall be present; the first two points are to be interpreted as the endpoints of the major axis and the second two points as the endpoints of the minor axis of an ellipse, some form of implementation dependent representation of which is to be drawn.
The notion of “open” or “closed” has no inherent meaning in the context of an arbitrary graphic, other than in the condition for the presence of Graphic Filled (0070,0024). The graphic has no semantic notion of an associated observation such as a region of interest, except that which the unformatted text in the same Item may describe.

      <section ref="C.23.1.1.2" name="">The Image Sets Sequence (0072,0020) within a Hanging Protocol Instance serves to identify the type of image or other object sets to which the Hanging Protocol is intended to apply. Multiple types of image sets may be identified for a Hanging Protocol, to combine, for example, multiple imaging studies for a specific anatomy, or multiple imaging studies performed over a period of time, to monitor the progress of a condition. All image sets shall be for the same patient.
The images to be included in an Image Set may be specified directly by matching attribute values within the images, or indirectly through Key Object Selection Documents or Presentation States by matching their attribute values.
Key Object Selection Documents shall be matched by their SOP Class UID. The available Key Object Selection Documents may be further matched on the values of their other attributes (e.g., Concept Name Code Sequence, Coding Scheme Designator = “DCM” and Code Value = “113003”, which has a code meaning of “For Surgery”). When the Hanging Protocol Instance is applied, the image object instances referenced by the matching Key Object Selection Document instances comprise the image set.
Presentation States shall be matched by their SOP Class UID. The available Presentation States may be further matched on the values of their other attributes (e.g., Content Label). When the Hanging Protocol Instance is applied, the image object instances referenced by the matching Presentation State instances comprise the image set.
Note: Image Sets Sequence (0072,0020) allows other objects such as waveforms and SR documents to be identified. However, Hanging Protocol Display module operations such as filtering, reformatting, and sorting are defined only for image objects. The only expectation for non-image objects is to associate the objects with a position on a screen.

      <description>Sequence containing Image Set selection attributes and values that are used to identify one type of image or object set for the Hanging Protocol. One or more sequence items shall be present. See C.23.1.1.3.</description>
      <section ref="C.23.1.1.3" name="">The Image Set Selector Sequence (0072,0022) contains sequence items that specify the DICOM attribute tags and values that shall be used to identify the image or other object set.
The Image Set Selector Usage Flag (0072,0024) indicates whether the attribute identified by the Selector Attribute (0072,0026) causes matching to succeed or fail if the attribute is not available in an image object.
Within a sequence item, the Selector Attribute (0072,0026) identifies a DICOM attribute tag that is likely to be present in image or other object instances that are desired for the Image Set. If it is a multi-valued attribute, the Selector Value Number (0072,0028) indicates which value is intended to be used for matching. The Selector Attribute VR (0072,0050) identifies the Value Representation of the Selector Attribute (0072,0026). The value of Selector Attribute VR (0072,0050) determines which attribute of the Hanging Protocol Selector Attribute Value Macro is required to specify one or more desired values for the DICOM attribute tag. If more than one value is specified for the attribute, or more than one sequence item is specified in the Selector Code Sequence Value (0072,0080), then image object instances with a corresponding attribute that matches any one of the values shall be included in the Image Set.
Note: The values used for the Selector Attribute (0072,0026) are intended to identify a type of image set via the general categories of modality, anatomy, procedure intent and/or reason. Therefore the values of the tags represented by Selector Attribute (0072,0026) are likely to be coded terms, enumerated values, defined terms or free text. The use of free text attributes is less desirable, because their values are less predictable for matching.
In an image object, some attributes occur at the top level, or nested within a Sequence or Functional Group Sequence, or both. In addition, a Private Attribute may be identified as a Selector Attribute (0072,0026). The attributes of the Hanging Protocol Selector Attribute Context Macro identify a Sequence, Functional Group Sequence, or Private Group context for the Selector Attribute (0072,0026).
The creator of a Hanging Protocol Instance uses this collection of attributes to identify one type of image set to which the Hanging Protocol is intended to apply. The user of a Hanging Protocol Instance (e.g., softcopy review workstation or pre-fetching application) uses this collection of attributes to match a specific image set to a Hanging Protocol, and/or to determine which image sets need to be retrieved in order to use a Hanging Protocol Instance. The Key Attributes to match against to obtain image sets are specified in the Selector Attribute (0072,0026) and its context in each sequence item.
If the value of the tag represented by Selector Attribute (0072,0026) contains a free text description (i.e., Selector Attribute VR = LO, SH, ST, LT, UT), whether exact or partial matching is used to identify a specific image instance when applying a Hanging Protocol Instance is implementation dependent.

      <section ref="C.23.3.1.1" name="">The items in the Filter Operations Sequence (0072,0400) determine which subset of the images in the identified Image Set are to be displayed in the associated Display Set image boxes. If there are multiple Items in the Filter Operations Sequence (0072,0400), the filter operations shall be applied in Item order, and the output of the preceding filter shall serve as the input to the succeeding filter (i.e., an AND operation).
When Filter-by Category (0072,0402) has a value of IMAGE_PLANE, Selector Attribute VR (0072,0050) shall have a value of “CS”, and abstract enumerated values shall be used for the value of the associated Selector CS Value (0072,0062) attribute, which may be computed from the values of Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037) or Patient Orientation (0020,0020). Enumerated Values: TRANSVERSE, CORONAL, SAGITTAL, OBLIQUE.
Note:  Cross-sectional images do not normally contain a categorical description of the image plane, but rather only a patient-relative row and column direction cosines that are unit vectors. The category of image plane can be determined first by categorizing the row and column major directions (or detecting if the orientation is oblique according to a pre-specified threshold), and then using those categories to select a plan category.
  The following pseudo-code can be used to determine the major axis (R or L, A or P, H or F) from a single direction cosine that is an (x,y,z) tuple (as defined in C.7.6.2.1.1):

    if (abs(x) &gt; threshold)
      axis = “RL”
    else if (abs(y) &gt; threshold)
      axis = “AP”
    else if (abs(z) &gt; threshold)
      axis = “HF”
    else
      is OBLIQUE

  Having determined the major axis of the row and column, the category of plane can be obtained from a table lookup:

<unrecognized-rows><term value=""/><term value="Row"/><term value="Column"/><term value="RL"/><term value="AP"/><term value="HF"/><term value="RL"/><term value=""/><term value="TRANSVERSE"/><term value="CORONAL"/><term value="AP"/><term value="TRANSVERSE"/><term value=""/><term value="SAGITTAL"/><term value="HF"/><term value="CORONAL"/><term value="SAGITTAL"/><term value=""/></unrecognized-rows>
  Alternatively, one can obtain a single vector that is the normal to the orientation (cross product of the row and column unit vectors), then find which of the x, y and z components has the maximum absolute value that is above threshold; if x then SAGITTAL, if y then CORONAL, if z then TRANSVERSE; if all of the components are below threshold then the orientation is OBLIQUE.

  Since it is also necessary to determine whether or not to flip or rotate the image into the preferred orientation (as specified by Display Set Patient orientation (0072,0700)) for the category of plane (e.g., sagittals are normally viewed with row direction posteriorly and column direction towards the feet), the categorical row and column direction to use can be obtained as above, additional accounting for the sign of the direction cosine, e.g.:

    if x &lt; 0 then orientationX = “R” else orientationX = “L”
    if y &lt; 0 then orientationY = “A” else orientationY = “P”
    if z &lt; 0 then orientationZ = “F” else orientationZ = “H”

      <section ref="C.23.3.1.2" name="">The Items in the Sorting Operations Sequence (0072,0600) define the order in which the images resulting from the filter and reformat operations on the Image Set are to be displayed in the associated Image Boxes of the Display Set. The sorting criteria may include the value of a numeric, date, or time Attribute that is expected to be present in each of the image objects in the filtered Image Set, and/or an abstract sorting category. A sorting direction shall be associated with each sorting criterion. If a textual Attribute is used for sorting, then the INCREASING sorting direction indicates alphabetical order, and DECREASING indicates reverse alphabetical order.
If a code sequence Attribute is used for sorting, then the Code Meaning (0008,0104) shall be sorted alphabetically. If a string numeric Attribute is used for sorting (VR of IS or DS), then sorting shall be on the numeric value, and padding shall be ignored. When sorting by date or time Attribute, then sorting shall be on the temporal value, not the alphabetic string.
If there are multiple Items in the Sorting Operations Sequence (0072,0600), then the sorting operations shall be applied in Item order. The least rapidly varying attribute for the sorting operation shall be the first Item in the sequence.
Note:  For example, a Sorting Operations Sequence (0072,0600) with two Items:
    Item #1: (0018,5101) View Position, INCREASING
    Item #2: (0008,0020) Study Date, INCREASING

When the Sort-by Category (0072,0602) is used with a value of ALONG_AXIS, such as for CT, MR or other cross-sectional image sets, the sorting operation is computed from the values Image Position (Patient) (0020,0032) and Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037) in the image objects.
For the image set to be displayed, a “dominant axis” of the set shall be determined. The dominant axis is the normal to the Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037) attribute (assuming all selected images are parallel), computed as the dot product in a right-handed coordinate system (see C.7.6.2.1.1). The INCREASING direction for ALONG_AXIS of the image set shall be in the positive direction along the dominant axis. The DECREASING direction shall be in the negative direction along that axis.
When the Sort-by Category (0072,0602) is used with a value of BY_ACQ_TIME, the sorting operation is computed from appropriate values in the image objects (e.g., Frame Acquisition DateTime, Acquisition Time, Content Time, Acquisition DateTime), since the specific attribute used may vary from one Image Instance or SOP Class to another, yet the Hanging Protocol Instance may be generally applicable.
An application that is applying a Hanging Protocol Instance shall support any value for Selector Attribute (0072,0026), provided that it is present in the referenced Image Set. The attributes of the Hanging Protocol Selector Attribute Context Macro specify whether the Selector Attribute (0072,0026) is contained in a Sequence, Functional Group Sequence or Private Group.
Notes:  1. The following attributes from image IODs are examples of some possible values for the Selector Attribute (0072,0026) of the Sorting Operations Sequence (0072,0600). This is not a complete list:

      <section ref="C.23.3.1.2" name="">The Items in the Sorting Operations Sequence (0072,0600) define the order in which the images resulting from the filter and reformat operations on the Image Set are to be displayed in the associated Image Boxes of the Display Set. The sorting criteria may include the value of a numeric, date, or time Attribute that is expected to be present in each of the image objects in the filtered Image Set, and/or an abstract sorting category. A sorting direction shall be associated with each sorting criterion. If a textual Attribute is used for sorting, then the INCREASING sorting direction indicates alphabetical order, and DECREASING indicates reverse alphabetical order.
If a code sequence Attribute is used for sorting, then the Code Meaning (0008,0104) shall be sorted alphabetically. If a string numeric Attribute is used for sorting (VR of IS or DS), then sorting shall be on the numeric value, and padding shall be ignored.

If there are multiple Items in the Sorting Operations Sequence (0072,0600), then the sorting operations shall be applied in Item order. The least rapidly varying attribute for the sorting operation shall be the first Item in the sequence.

    Item #1: (0018,5101) View Position, INCREASING

If the Attribute Specific Character Set (0008,0005) is not present or has only a single value, Code Extension techniques are not used. Defined terms for the Attribute Specific Character Set (0008,0005), when single valued, are derived from the International Registration Number as per ISO 2375 (e.g., ISO_IR 100 for Latin alphabet No. 1). See Table C.12-2.
Table C.12-2

Note:  To use the single-byte code table of JIS X0201, the value of attribute Specific Character Set (0008,0005), value 1 should be ISO_IR 13. This means that ISO-IR 13 is designated as the G1 code element which is invoked in the GR area. It should be understood that, in addition, ISO-IR 14 is designated as the G0 code element and this is invoked in the GL area.

If the attribute Specific Character Set (0008,0005) has more than one value, Code Extension techniques are used and Escape Sequences may be encountered in all character sets. Requirements for the use of Code Extension techniques are specified in PS 3.5. In order to indicate the presence of Code Extension, the Defined Terms for the repertoires have the prefix “ISO 2022”, e.g., ISO 2022 IR 100 for the Latin Alphabet No. 1. See Table 12-3 and Table 12-4. Table 12-3 describes single-byte character sets for value 1 to value n of the attribute Specific Character Set (0008,0005), and Table 12-4 describes multi-byte character sets for value 2 to value n of the attribute Specific Character Set (0008,0005).
Note:  A prefix other than “ISO 2022” may be needed in the future if other Code Extension techniques are adopted.

There are multi-byte character sets that prohibit the use of Code Extension Techniques. The Unicode character set used in ISO 10646, when encoded in UTF-8, and the GB18030 character set, encoded per the rules of GB18030, both prohibit the use of Code Extension Techniques. These character sets may only be specified as value 1 in the Specific Character Set (0008,0005) attribute and there shall only be one value. The minimal length UTF-8 encoding shall always be used for ISO 10646.
Notes:  1. The ISO standards for 10646 now prohibit the use of anything but the minimum length encoding for UTF-8. UTF-8 permits multiple different encodings, but when used to encode Unicode characters in accordance with ISO 10646-1 and 10646-2 (with extensions) only the minimal encodings are legal.
  2. The representation for the characters in the DICOM Default Character Repertoire is the same single byte value for the Default Character Repertoire, ISO 10646 in UTF-8, and GB18030. It is also the 7-bit US-ASCII encoding.

ASCCONV does contain most of the good info. In particular the slice
ordering is encoded thus:

    sSliceArray.ucMode -- should be in (1, 2, 4)
    enum SeriesMode
    {
      ASCENDING   = 0x01,
      DESCENDING  = 0x02,
      INTERLEAVED = 0x04
    };

And when interleaved, the slice ordering depends on whether the number
of slices is even or odd. I have it coded (counting from zero) as:

if ODD:
  slice_order = {0, 2, 4, ..., N-1, 1, 3, 5, ..., N-2}
else:
  slice_order = {1, 3, 5, ..., N-1, 0, 2, 4, ..., N-2}

which I can't immediately confirm, but I'm reasonably confident about it.

It's all a bit of a mess, but there is some code available on the CIRL
repo in bic/trunk/recon-tools/root/scanner/siemens.py

check out parse_siemens_hdr() in that module, where I also documented
various useful fields. And there are the helper functions (
strip_ascconv(), condense_array() ) in siemens_utils.py. No
docstrings, so ping me if you need clarification.

# For GCC 8, promote maybe-initialized warnings to an error.  GCC 8
# reports 0 maybe-uninitialized warnings where earlier versions
# make many false reports.  GCC 8 seems to analyze calls to static
# in order to detect initializations that occur there.  It's possible
# that GCC 8 only performs that analysis at -O3, though.

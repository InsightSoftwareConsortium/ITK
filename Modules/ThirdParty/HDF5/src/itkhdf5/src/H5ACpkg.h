 *
 * structure H5AC_aux_t
 *
 * While H5AC has become a wrapper for the cache implemented in H5C.c, there
 * are some features of the metadata cache that are specific to it, and which
 * therefore do not belong in the more generic H5C cache code.
 *
 * In particular, there is the matter of synchronizing writes from the
 * metadata cache to disk in the PHDF5 case.
 *
 * Prior to this update, the presumption was that all metadata caches would
 * write the same data at the same time since all operations modifying
 * metadata must be performed collectively.  Given this assumption, it was
 * safe to allow only the writes from process 0 to actually make it to disk,
 * while metadata writes from all other processes were discarded.
 *
 * Unfortunately, this presumption is in error as operations that read
 * metadata need not be collective, but can change the location of dirty
 * entries in the metadata cache LRU lists.  This can result in the same
 * metadata write operation triggering writes from the metadata caches on
 * some processes, but not all (causing a hang), or in different sets of
 * entries being written from different caches (potentially resulting in
 * metadata corruption in the file).
 *
 * To deal with this issue, I decided to apply a paradigm shift to the way
 * metadata is written to disk.
 *
 * With this set of changes, only the metadata cache on process 0 is able
 * to write metadata to disk, although metadata caches on all other
 * processes can read metadata from disk as before.
 *
 * To keep all the other caches from getting plugged up with dirty metadata,
 * process 0 periodically broadcasts a list of entries that it has flushed
 * since that last notice, and which are currently clean.  The other caches
 * mark these entries as clean as well, which allows them to evict the
 * entries as needed.
 *
 * One obvious problem in this approach is synchronizing the broadcasts
 * and receptions, as different caches may see different amounts of
 * activity.
 *
 * The current solution is for the caches to track the number of bytes
 * of newly generated dirty metadata, and to broadcast and receive
 * whenever this value exceeds some user specified threshold.
 *
 * Maintaining this count is easy for all processes not on process 0 --
 * all that is necessary is to add the size of the entry to the total
 * whenever there is an insertion, a move of a previously clean entry,
 * or whever a previously clean entry is marked dirty in an unprotect.
 *
 * On process 0, we have to be careful not to count dirty bytes twice.
 * If an entry is marked dirty, flushed, and marked dirty again, all
 * within a single reporting period, it only th first marking should
 * be added to the dirty bytes generated tally, as that is all that
 * the other processes will see.
 *
 * At present, this structure exists to maintain the fields needed to
 * implement the above scheme, and thus is only used in the parallel
 * case.  However, other uses may arise in the future.
 *
 * Instance of this structure are associated with metadata caches via
 * the aux_ptr field of H5C_t (see H5Cpkg.h).  The H5AC code is
 * responsible for allocating, maintaining, and discarding instances
 * of H5AC_aux_t.
 *
 * The remainder of this header comments documents the individual fields
 * of the structure.
 *
 *                                              JRM - 6/27/05
 *
 * Update: When the above was written, I planned to allow the process
 *	0 metadata cache to write dirty metadata between sync points.
 *	However, testing indicated that this allowed occasional
 *	messages from the future to reach the caches on other processes.
 *
 *	To resolve this, the code was altered to require that all metadata
 *	writes take place during sync points -- which solved the problem.
 *	Initially all writes were performed by the process 0 cache.  This
 *	approach was later replaced with a distributed write approach
 *	in which each process writes a subset of the metadata to be
 *	written.
 *
 *	After thinking on the matter for a while, I arrived at the
 *	conclusion that the process 0 cache could be allowed to write
 *	dirty metadata between sync points if it restricted itself to
 *	entries that had been dirty at the time of the previous sync point.
 *
 *	To date, there has been no attempt to implement this optimization.
 *	However, should it be attempted, much of the supporting code
 *	should still be around.

 *						JRM -- 1/6/15
 *
 * magic:       Unsigned 32 bit integer always set to
 *		H5AC__H5AC_AUX_T_MAGIC.  This field is used to validate
 *		pointers to instances of H5AC_aux_t.
 *
 * mpi_comm:	MPI communicator associated with the file for which the
 *		cache has been created.
 *
 * mpi_rank:	MPI rank of this process within mpi_comm.
 *
 * mpi_size:	Number of processes in mpi_comm.
 *
 * write_permitted:  Boolean flag used to control whether the cache
 *		is permitted to write to file.
 *
 * dirty_bytes_threshold: Integer field containing the dirty bytes
 *		generation threshold.  Whenever dirty byte creation
 *		exceeds this value, the metadata cache on process 0
 *		broadcasts a list of the entries it has flushed since
 *		the last broadcast (or since the beginning of execution)
 *		and which are currently clean (if they are still in the
 *		cache)
 *
 *		Similarly, metadata caches on processes other than process
 *		0 will attempt to receive a list of clean entries whenever
 *		the threshold is exceeded.
 *
 * dirty_bytes:  Integer field containing the number of bytes of dirty
 *		metadata generated since the beginning of the computation,
 *		or (more typically) since the last clean entries list
 *		broadcast.  This field is reset to zero after each such
 *		broadcast.
 *
 * metadata_write_strategy: Integer code indicating how we will be
 *		writing the metadata.  In the first incarnation of
 *		this code, all writes were done from process 0.  This
 *		field exists to facilitate experiments with other
 *		strategies.
 *
 *		At present, this field must be set to either
 *		H5AC_METADATA_WRITE_STRATEGY__PROCESS_0_ONLY or
 *		H5AC_METADATA_WRITE_STRATEGY__DISTRIBUTED.
 *
 * dirty_bytes_propagations: This field only exists when the
 *		H5AC_DEBUG_DIRTY_BYTES_CREATION #define is TRUE.
 *
 *		It is used to track the number of times the cleaned list
 *		has been propagated from process 0 to the other
 *		processes.
 *
 * unprotect_dirty_bytes:  This field only exists when the
 *              H5AC_DEBUG_DIRTY_BYTES_CREATION #define is TRUE.
 *
 *		It is used to track the number of dirty bytes created
 *		via unprotect operations since the last time the cleaned
 *		list was propagated.
 *
 * unprotect_dirty_bytes_updates: This field only exists when the
 *              H5AC_DEBUG_DIRTY_BYTES_CREATION #define is TRUE.
 *
 *		It is used to track the number of times dirty bytes have
 *		been created via unprotect operations since the last time
 *		the cleaned list was propagated.
 *
 * insert_dirty_bytes:  This field only exists when the
 *              H5AC_DEBUG_DIRTY_BYTES_CREATION #define is TRUE.
 *
 *		It is used to track the number of dirty bytes created
 *		via insert operations since the last time the cleaned
 *		list was propagated.
 *
 * insert_dirty_bytes_updates:  This field only exists when the
 *              H5AC_DEBUG_DIRTY_BYTES_CREATION #define is TRUE.
 *
 *		It is used to track the number of times dirty bytes have
 *		been created via insert operations since the last time
 *		the cleaned list was propagated.
 *
 * move_dirty_bytes:  This field only exists when the
 *              H5AC_DEBUG_DIRTY_BYTES_CREATION #define is TRUE.
 *
 *		It is used to track the number of dirty bytes created
 *		via move operations since the last time the cleaned
 *		list was propagated.
 *
 * move_dirty_bytes_updates:  This field only exists when the
 *              H5AC_DEBUG_DIRTY_BYTES_CREATION #define is TRUE.
 *
 *		It is used to track the number of times dirty bytes have
 *		been created via move operations since the last time
 *		the cleaned list was propagated.
 *
 * Things have changed a bit since the following four fields were defined.
 * If metadata_write_strategy is H5AC_METADATA_WRITE_STRATEGY__PROCESS_0_ONLY,
 * all comments hold as before -- with the caviate that pending further
 * coding, the process 0 metadata cache is forbidden to flush entries outside
 * of a sync point.
 *
 * However, for different metadata write strategies, these fields are used
 * only to maintain the correct dirty byte count on process zero -- and in
 * most if not all cases, this is redundant, as process zero will be barred
 * from flushing entries outside of a sync point.
 *
 *						JRM -- 3/16/10
 *
 * d_slist_ptr:  Pointer to an instance of H5SL_t used to maintain a list
 *		of entries that have been dirtied since the last time they
 *		were listed in a clean entries broadcast.  This list is
 *		only maintained by the metadata cache on process 0 -- it
 *		it used to maintain a view of the dirty entries as seen
 *		by the other caches, so as to keep the dirty bytes count
 *		in synchronization with them.
 *
 *		Thus on process 0, the dirty_bytes count is incremented
 *		only if either
 *
 *		1) an entry is inserted in the metadata cache, or
 *
 *		2) a previously clean entry is moved, and it does not
 *		   already appear in the dirty entry list, or
 *
 *		3) a previously clean entry is unprotected with the
 *		   dirtied flag set and the entry does not already appear
 *		   in the dirty entry list.
 *
 *		Entries are added to the dirty entry list whever they cause
 *		the dirty bytes count to be increased.  They are removed
 *		when they appear in a clean entries broadcast.  Note that
 *		moves must be reflected in the dirty entry list.
 *
 *		To reitterate, this field is only used on process 0 -- it
 *		should be NULL on all other processes.
 *
 * c_slist_ptr: Pointer to an instance of H5SL_t used to maintain a list
 *		of entries that were dirty, have been flushed
 *		to disk since the last clean entries broadcast, and are
 *		still clean.  Since only process 0 can write to disk, this
 *		list only exists on process 0.
 *
 *		In essence, this slist is used to assemble the contents of
 *		the next clean entries broadcast.  The list emptied after
 *		each broadcast.
 *
 * The following two fields are used only when metadata_write_strategy
 * is H5AC_METADATA_WRITE_STRATEGY__DISTRIBUTED.
 *
 * candidate_slist_ptr: Pointer to an instance of H5SL_t used by process 0
 *		to construct a list of entries to be flushed at this sync
 *		point.  This list is then broadcast to the other processes,
 *		which then either flush or mark clean all entries on it.
 *
 * write_done:  In the parallel test bed, it is necessary to ensure that
 *              all writes to the server process from cache 0 complete
 *              before it enters the barrier call with the other caches.
 *
 *              The write_done callback allows t_cache to do this without
 *              requiring an ACK on each write.  Since these ACKs greatly
 *              increase the run time on some platforms, this is a
 *              significant optimization.
 *
 *              This field must be set to NULL when the callback is not
 *              needed.
 *
 *		Note: This field has been extended for use by all processes
 *		      with the addition of support for the distributed
 *		      metadata write strategy.
 *                                                     JRM -- 5/9/10
 *
 * sync_point_done:  In the parallel test bed, it is necessary to verify
 *		that the expected writes, and only the expected writes,
 *		have taken place at the end of each sync point.
 *
 *		The sync_point_done callback allows t_cache to perform
 *		this verification.  The field is set to NULL when the
 *		callback is not needed.
 *
 * The following field supports the metadata cache image feature.
 *
 * p0_image_len: unsiged integer containing the length of the metadata cache
 *		image constructed by MPI process 0.  This field should be 0
 *		if the value is unknown, or if cache image is not enabled.

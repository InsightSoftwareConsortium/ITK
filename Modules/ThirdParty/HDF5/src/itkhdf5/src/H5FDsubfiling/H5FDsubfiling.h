 *      The method to use for selecting MPI ranks to be I/O concentrators. The

 *      Refer to #H5FD_subfiling_ioc_select_t for a description of the algorithms
 *      available for use.
 *
 * \var int64_t H5FD_subfiling_params_t::stripe_size
 *      The stripe size defines the size (in bytes) of the data stripes in the
 *      subfiles for the logical HDF5 file. Data is striped across the subfiles
 *      in a round-robin wrap-around fashion in segments equal to the stripe size.
 *
 *      For example, in an HDF5 file consisting of four subfiles with a 1MiB stripe
 *      size, the first and fifth 1MiB of data would reside in the first subfile,
 *      the second and sixth 1MiB of data would reside in the second subfile and so
 *      on.
 *
 *      This value can also be set or adjusted with the #H5FD_SUBFILING_STRIPE_SIZE
 *      environment variable.
 *
 * \var int32_t H5FD_subfiling_params_t::stripe_count
 *      The target number of subfiles to use for the logical HDF5 file. The current
 *      default is to use one subfile per node, but it can be useful to set a
 *      different target number of subfiles, especially if the HDF5 application will
 *      pre-create the HDF5 file on a single MPI rank. In that particular case, the
 *      single rank will need to know how many subfiles the logical HDF5 file will
 *      consist of in order to properly pre-create the file.
 *
 *      This value is used in conjunction with the IOC selection method to determine
 *      which MPI ranks will be assigned as I/O concentrators. Alternatively, the
 *      mapping between MPI ranks and I/O concentrators can be set or adjusted with a
 *      combination of the #ioc_selection field and the #H5FD_SUBFILING_IOC_PER_NODE
 *      and #H5FD_SUBFILING_IOC_SELECTION_CRITERIA environment variables.

 *          #H5FD_SUBFILING driver.
 *
 *          The #H5FD_SUBFILING driver is an MPI-based file driver that allows an
 *          HDF5 application to distribute a logical HDF5 file across a collection
 *          of "subfiles" in equal-sized data segment "stripes". I/O to the logical
 *          HDF5 file is then directed to the appropriate "subfile" according to the
 *          #H5FD_SUBFILING configuration and a system of I/O concentrators, which
 *          are MPI ranks operating worker threads.
 *
 *          By allowing a configurable stripe size, number of I/O concentrators and
 *          method for selecting MPI ranks as I/O concentrators, the #H5FD_SUBFILING
 *          driver aims to enable an HDF5 application to find a middle ground between
 *          the single shared file and file-per-process approaches to parallel file I/O
 *          for the particular machine the application is running on. In general, the
 *          goal is to avoid some of the complexity of the file-per-process approach
 *          while also minimizing the locking issues of the single shared file approach
 *          on a parallel file system.
 *
 * \note Since the #H5FD_SUBFILING driver is an MPI-based file driver, the HDF5
 *       application should ensure that H5Pset_mpi_params() is called before this
 *       routine so that the appropriate MPI communicator and info objects will be
 *       setup for use by the #H5FD_SUBFILING and #H5FD_IOC drivers.
 *
 * \note The current architecture of the #H5FD_SUBFILING driver requires that the
 *       HDF5 application must have been initialized with MPI_Init_thread() using
 *       a value of MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE for the thread support level.
 *
 * \note The \p vfd_config parameter may be NULL. In this case, the reference
 *       implementation I/O concentrator VFD will be used with the default settings
 *       of one I/O concentrator per node and a stripe size of 32MiB. Refer to the

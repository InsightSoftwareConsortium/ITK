 * IOC I/O Queue management macros:

 * The following macros perform the necessary operations on the IOC I/O

 *
 * WARNING: q_ptr->q_mutex must be held when these macros are executed..
 *
 * At present, the necessary operations are append (insert an entry at the
 * end of the queue), and delete (remove an entry from the queue).
 *
 * At least initially, all sanity checking is done with asserts, as the
 * the existing I/O concentrator code is not well integrated into the HDF5

 *
 * structure ioc_io_queue_entry
 *
 * magic:  Unsigned 32 bit integer always set to H5FD_IOC__IO_Q_ENTRY_MAGIC.
 *         This field is used to validate pointers to instances of
 *         ioc_io_queue_entry_t.
 *
 * next:   Next pointer in the doubly linked list used to implement
 *         the IOC I/O Queue.  This field points to the next entry
 *         in the queue, or NULL if there is no next entry.
 *
 * prev:   Prev pointer in the doubly linked list used to implement
 *         the IOC I/O Queue.  This field points to the previous entry
 *         in the queue, or NULL if there is no previous entry.
 *
 * in_progress: Boolean flag that must be FALSE when the entry is inserted
 *         into the IOC I/O Queue, and set to TRUE when the entry is dispatched
 *         to the worker thread pool for execution.
 *
 *         When in_progress is FALS, the entry is said to be pending.
 *
 * counter: uint32_t containing a serial number assigned to this IOC
 *         I/O Queue entry.  Note that this will roll over on long
 *         computations, and thus is not in general unique.
 *
 *         The counter fields is used to construct a tag to distinguish
 *         multiple concurrent I/O requests from a give rank, and thus
 *         this should not be a problem as long as there is sufficient
 *         time between roll overs.  As only the lower bits of the counter
 *         are used in tag construction, this is more frequent than the
 *         size of the counter field would suggest -- albeit hopefully
 *         still infrequent enough.
 *
 * wk_req: Instance of sf_work_request_t.  Replace with individual
 *         fields when convenient.
 *
 *
 * Statistics:
 *
 * The following fields are only defined if H5FD_IOC_COLLECT_STATS is TRUE.
 * They are intended to allow collection of basic statistics on the
 * behaviour of the IOC I/O Queue for purposes of debugging and performance
 * optimization.
 *
 * q_time:      uint64_t containing the time the entry was place on the
 *              IOC I/O Queue in usec after the UNIX epoch.
 *
 *              This value is used to compute the queue wait time, and the
 *              total processing time for the entry.
 *
 * dispatch_time:  uint64_t containing the time the entry is dispatched in
 *              usec after the UNIX epoch.  This field is undefined if the
 *              entry is pending.
 *
 *              This value is used to compute the execution time for the
 *              entry.

/****************************************************************************
 *
 * structure ioc_io_queue
 *
 * This is a temporary structure -- its fields should be moved to an I/O
 * concentrator Catchall structure eventually.
 *
 * The fields of this structure support the io queue used to receive and
 * sequence I/O requests for execution by the worker threads.  The rules
 * for sequencing are as follows:
 *
 * 1) Non-overlaping I/O requests must be fed to the worker threads in
 *    the order received, and may execute concurrently
 *
 * 2) Overlapping read requests must be fed to the worker threads in
 *    the order received, but may execute concurrently.
 *
 * 3) If any pair of I/O requests overlap, and at least one is a write
 *    request, they must be executed in strict arrival order, and the
 *    first must complete before the second starts.
 *
 * Due to the strict ordering requirement in rule 3, entries must be
 * inserted at the tail of the queue in receipt order, and retained on
 * the queue until completed.  Entries in the queue are marked pending
 * when inserted on the queue, in progress when handed to a worker
 * thread, and deleted from the queue when completed.
 *
 * The dispatch algorithm is as follows:
 *
 * 1) Set X equal to the element at the head of the queue.
 *
 * 2) If X is pending, and there exists no prior element (i.e. between X
 *    and the head of the queue) that intersects with X, goto 5).
 *
 * 3) If X is pending, X is a read, and all prior intersecting elements
 *    are reads, goto 5).
 *
 * 4) If X is in progress, or if any prior intersecting element is a
 *    write, or if X is a write, set X equal to its successor in the
 *    queue (i.e. the next element further down the queue from the head)
 *    and goto 2)  If there is no next element, exit without dispatching
 *    any I/O request.
 *
 * 5) If we get to 5, X must be pending.  Mark it in progress, and
 *    dispatch it.  If the number of in progress entries is less than
 *    the number of worker threads, and X has a successor in the queue,
 *    set X equal to its predecessor, and goto 2).  Otherwise exit without
 *    dispatching further I/O requests.
 *
 * Note that the above dispatch algorithm doesn't address collective
 * I/O requests -- this should be OK for now, but it will have to
 * addressed prior to production release.
 *
 * On I/O request completion, worker threads must delete their assigned
 * I/O requests from the queue, check to see if there are any pending
 * requests, and trigger the dispatch algorithm if there are.
 *
 * The fields in the structure are discussed individually below.
 *
 * magic:  Unsigned 32 bit integer always set to H5FD_IOC__IO_Q_MAGIC.
 *         This field is used to validate pointers to instances of
 *         H5C_t.
 *
 * q_head: Pointer to the head of the doubly linked list of entries in
 *         the I/O queue.
 *
 *         This field is NULL if the I/O queue is empty.
 *
 * q_tail: Pointer to the tail of the doubly linked list of entries in
 *         the I/O queue.
 *
 *         This field is NULL if the I/O queue is empty.
 *
 * num_pending:  Number of I/O request pending on the I/O queue.
 *
 * num_in_progress: Number of I/O requests in progress on the I/O queue.
 *
 * q_len:  Number of I/O requests on the I/O queue.  Observe that q_len
 *         must equal (num_pending + num_in_progress).
 *
 * req_counter: unsigned 16 bit integer used to provide a "unique" tag for
 *         each I/O request.  This value is incremented by 1, and then
 *         passed to the worker thread where its lower bits are incorporated
 *         into the tag used to disambiguate multiple, concurrent I/O
 *         requests from a single rank.  The value is 32 bits, as MPI tags
 *         are limited to 32 bits.  The value is unsigned as it is expected
 *         to wrap around once its maximum value is reached.
 *
 * q_mutex: Mutex used to ensure that only one thread accesses the IOC I/O
 *         Queue at once.  This mutex must be held to access of modify
 *         all fields of the
 *
 *
 * Statistics:
 *
 * The following fields are only defined if H5FD_IOC_COLLECT_STATS is TRUE.
 * They are intended to allow collection of basic statistics on the
 * behaviour of the IOC I/O Queue for purposes of debugging and performance
 * optimization.
 *
 * max_q_len: Maximum number of requests residing on the IOC I/O Queue at
 *         any point in time in the current run.
 *
 * max_num_pending: Maximum number of pending requests residing on the IOC
 *         I/O Queue at any point in time in the current run.
 *
 * max_num_in_progress: Maximum number of in progress requests residing on
 *         the IOC I/O Queue at any point in time in the current run.
 *
 * ind_read_requests:  Number of independent read requests received by the
 *          IOC to date.
 *
 * ind_write_requests Number of independent write requests received by the
 *          IOC to date.
 *
 * truncate_requests:  Number of truncate requests received by the IOC to
 *           date.
 *
 * get_eof_requests: Number fo get EOF request received by the IO to date.
 *
 * requests_queued: Number of I/O requests received and placed on the IOC
 *          I/O queue.
 *
 * requests_dispatched: Number of I/O requests dispatched for execution by
 *          the worker threads.
 *
 * requests_completed: Number of I/O requests completed by the worker threads.
 *          Observe that on file close, requests_queued, requests_dispatched,
 *          and requests_completed should be equal.

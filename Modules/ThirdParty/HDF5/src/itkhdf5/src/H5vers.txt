# This file is used to generate the various headers that are needed for
# versioning the public symbols for the library.
#
# The bin/make_vers script reads in this file and creates the appropriate files
# in the src/ directory when the generated headers are out of date with respect
# to this file.
#
# Blank lines and lines beginning with '#' are ignored
#
# The format of this file is as follows:
#  <type>: <base routine name>; <list of parameter types for function>; <version introduced>, <list of revised versions>
#
# Where <type> is either 'FUNCTION' or 'TYPEDEF'
#
# For example, the following sample input shows two functions with different
# API versions for each.  The example below shows H5Gfoo being added to the
# library in the v1.0 branch and revised in the v1.4 and v1.8 branches (so
# there should be three versioned names for the routine: H5Gfoo1, H5Gfoo2 and
# H5Gfoo3).  H5Gbar is shown as being added to the library in the v1.2 branch
# (so the "base" version of the API name wouldn't appear if the library
# was configured with the default API interface corresponding to v1.0) and
# revised in the v1.6 branch (so there should be two versioned names for the
# routine: H5Gbar1 and H5Gbar2).
#
# FUNCTION: H5Gfoo; ; v10, v14, v18
# FUNCTION: H5Gbar; ; v12, v16

# The format of this file is as follows:
#  <type>,<major section, if minor type, otherwise omitted>,<name>,<description>
#
# For example, the following sample input shows two major errors and two minor
# errors in each section:
#
# MAJOR, H5E_ARGS, Invalid arguments to routine
# MAJOR, H5E_RESOURCE, Resource unavailable
#
# SECTION, ARGS, Argument errors
# SECTION, RESOURCE, Resource errors
#
# MINOR, ARGS, H5E_UNINITIALIZED, Information is uinitialized
# MINOR, ARGS, H5E_UNSUPPORTED, Feature is unsupported
# MINOR, RESOURCE, H5E_NOSPACE, No space available for allocation
# MINOR, RESOURCE, H5E_CANTCOPY, unable to copy object
#
# The section information is just used for grouping the information in the
# files created and can have any value.  They generally correspond to the
# major errors, but don't have to.  The section definition for each minor error
# must come before any minor error that uses it.

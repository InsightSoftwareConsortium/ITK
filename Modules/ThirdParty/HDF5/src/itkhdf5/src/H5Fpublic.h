 *          creates a new HDF5 file with the specified name and property lists.
 *
 *          The \p filename parameter specifies the name of the new file.
 *
 *          The \p flags parameter specifies whether an existing file is to be
 *          overwritten. It should be set to either #H5F_ACC_TRUNC to overwrite
 *          an existing file or #H5F_ACC_EXCL, instructing the function to fail
 *          if the file already exists.
 *
 *          New files are always created in read-write mode, so the read-write
 *          and read-only flags, #H5F_ACC_RDWR and #H5F_ACC_RDONLY,
 *          respectively, are not relevant in this function. Further note that
 *          a specification of #H5F_ACC_RDONLY will be ignored; the file will
 *          be created in read-write mode, regardless.
 *
 *          More complex behaviors of file creation and access are controlled
 *          through the file creation and file access property lists,
 *          \p fcpl_id and \p fapl_id, respectively. The value of #H5P_DEFAULT
 *          for any property list value indicates that the library should use
 *          the default values for that appropriate property list.
 *
 *          The return value is a file identifier for the newly-created file;
 *          this file identifier should be closed by calling H5Fclose() when
 *          it is no longer needed.
 *
 * \par Example
 * \snippet H5F_examples.c minimal
 *
 * \note  #H5F_ACC_TRUNC and #H5F_ACC_EXCL are mutually exclusive; use
 *        exactly one.
 *
 * \note An additional flag, #H5F_ACC_DEBUG, prints debug information. This
 *       flag can be combined with one of the above values using the bit-wise
 *       OR operator (\c |), but it is used only by HDF5 library developers;
 *       \Emph{it is neither tested nor supported for use in applications}.
 *
 * \attention \Bold{Special case — File creation in the case of an already-open file:}
 *            If a file being created is already opened, by either a previous
 *            H5Fopen() or H5Fcreate() call, the HDF5 library may or may not
 *            detect that the open file and the new file are the same physical
 *            file. (See H5Fopen() regarding the limitations in detecting the
 *            re-opening of an already-open file.)\n
 *            If the library detects that the file is already opened,
 *            H5Fcreate() will return a failure, regardless of the use of
 *            #H5F_ACC_TRUNC.\n
 *            If the library does not detect that the file is already opened
 *            and #H5F_ACC_TRUNC is not used, H5Fcreate() will return a failure
 *            because the file already exists. Note that this is correct
 *            behavior.\n
 *            But if the library does not detect that the file is already
 *            opened and #H5F_ACC_TRUNC is used, H5Fcreate() will truncate the
 *            existing file and return a valid file identifier. Such a
 *            truncation of a currently-opened file will almost certainly
 *            result in errors. While unlikely, the HDF5 library may not be
 *            able to detect, and thus report, such errors.\n
 *            Applications should avoid calling H5Fcreate() with an already

 * \par Example

 *            identifier established in a previous H5Fopen() or H5Fcreate()

 *            long as the identifier remains valid. In such multiply-opened
 *            cases, the open calls must use the same flags argument and the
 *            file access property lists must use the same file close degree
 *            property setting (see the external link discussion below and
 *            H5Pset_fclose_degree()).\n
 *            In some cases, such as files on a local Unix file system, the
 *            HDF5 library can detect that a file is multiply opened and will
 *            maintain coherent access among the file identifiers.\n
 *            But in many other cases, such as parallel file systems or
 *            networked file systems, it is not always possible to detect

 *       or more objects within the file remain open, those objects will remain
 *       accessible until they are individually closed. Thus, if the dataset

 *       Be warned, however, that there are circumstances where it is not

 *       would make any future access to the file, or any object within it,
 *       illegal.\n

 *
 * \details The metadata cache is a central part of the HDF5 library through
 *          which all \Emph{file metadata} reads and writes take place. File
 *          metadata is normally invisible to the user and is used by the
 *          library for purposes such as locating and indexing data. File
 *          metadata should not be confused with user metadata, which consists
 *          of attributes created by users and attached to HDF5 objects such
 *          as datasets via H5A API calls.
 *
 *          Due to the complexity of the cache, a trace/logging feature has been
 *          created that can be used by HDF5 developers for debugging and performance
 *          analysis. The functions that control this functionality will normally be
 *          of use to a very limited number of developers outside of The HDF Group.
 *          The functions have been documented to help users create logs that can
 *          be sent with bug reports.
 *
 *          Control of the log functionality is straightforward. Logging is enabled
 *          via the H5Pset_mdc_log_options() function, which will modify the file
 *          access property list used to open or create a file. This function has
 *          a flag that determines whether logging begins at file open or starts
 *          in a paused state. Log messages can then be controlled via the
 *          H5Fstart_mdc_logging() and H5Fstop_mdc_logging() functions.
 *          H5Pget_mdc_log_options() can be used to examine a file access property
 *          list, and H5Fget_mdc_logging_status() will return the current state of
 *          the logging flags.
 *
 *          The log format is described in the \ref_mdc_logging document.
 *
 * \note Unlike H5Fstart_mdc_logging() and H5Fstop_mdc_logging(), this function can
 *       be called on any open file identifier.

 * \returns \herr_t
 *
 * \par Motivation
 * H5Fset_mpi_atomicity() is applicable only in parallel environments using MPI I/O.
 * The function is one of the tools used to ensure sequential consistency. This means
 * that a set of operations will behave as though they were performed in a serial
 * order consistent with the program order.
 *
 * \details
 * \parblock
 * H5Fset_mpi_atomicity() sets MPI consistency semantics for data access to the file,
 * \p file_id.
 *
 * If \p flag is set to \c 1, all file access operations will appear atomic, guaranteeing
 * sequential consistency. If \p flag is set to \c 0, enforcement of atomic file access
 * will be turned off.
 *
 * H5Fset_mpi_atomicity() is a collective function and all participating processes must
 * pass the same values for \p file_id and \p flag.
 *
 * This function is available only when the HDF5 library is configured with parallel support
 * (\Code{--enable-parallel}). It is useful only when used with the #H5FD_MPIO driver
 * (see H5Pset_fapl_mpio()).
 * \endparblock
 *
 * \attention
 * \parblock
 * H5Fset_mpi_atomicity() calls \Code{MPI_File_set_atomicity} underneath and is not supported
 * if the execution platform does not support \Code{MPI_File_set_atomicity}. When it is
 * supported and used, the performance of data access operations may drop significantly.
 *
 * In certain scenarios, even when \Code{MPI_File_set_atomicity} is supported, setting
 * atomicity with H5Fset_mpi_atomicity() and \p flag set to 1 does not always yield
 * strictly atomic updates. For example, some H5Dwrite() calls translate to multiple
 * \Code{MPI_File_write_at} calls. This happens in all cases where the high-level file
 * access routine translates to multiple lower level file access routines.
 * The following scenarios will raise this issue:
 * \li Non-contiguous file access using independent I/O
 * \li Partial collective I/O using chunked access
 * \li Collective I/O using filters or when data conversion is required
 *
 * This issue arises because MPI atomicity is a matter of MPI file access operations rather
 * than HDF5 access operations. But the user is normally seeking atomicity at the HDF5 level.
 * To accomplish this, the application must set a barrier after a write, H5Dwrite(), but before
 * the next read, H5Dread(), in addition to calling H5Fset_mpi_atomicity().The barrier will
 * guarantee that all underlying write operations execute atomically before the read
 * operations starts. This ensures additional ordering semantics and will normally produce
 * the desired behavior.

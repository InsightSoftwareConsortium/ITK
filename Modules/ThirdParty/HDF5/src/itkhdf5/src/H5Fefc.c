/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Function:    H5F__efc_try_close
 *
 * Purpose:     Attempts to close the provided (shared) file by checking
 *              to see if the releasing the EFC would cause its reference
 *              count to drop to 0.  Necessary to handle the case where
 *              chained EFCs form a cycle.  Note that this function does
 *              not actually close the file (though it closes all children
 *              as appropriate), as that is left up to the calling
 *              function H5F_try_close().
 *
 *              Because H5F_try_close() has no way of telling if it is
 *              called recursively from within this function, this
 *              function serves as both the root of iteration and the
 *              "callback" for the final pass (the one where the files are
 *              actually closed).  The code for the callback case is at
 *              the top of this function; luckily it only consists of a
 *              (possible) call to H5F__efc_release_real().
 *
 *              The algorithm basically consists of 3 passes over the EFC
 *              tree.  The first pass assumes that every reachable file is
 *              closed, and keeps track of what the final reference count
 *              would be for every reachable file.  The files are then
 *              tagged as either closeable or uncloseable based on whether
 *              this reference count drops to 0.
 *
 *              The second pass initiates a traversal from each file
 *              marked as uncloseable in the first pass, and marks every
 *              file reachable from the initial uncloseable file as
 *              uncloseable.  This eliminates files that were marked as
 *              closeable only because the first pass assumed that an
 *              uncloseable file would be closed.
 *
 *              The final pass exploits the H5F__efc_release_real()->
 *              H5F__efc_remove_ent()->H5F_try_close()->H5F__efc_try_close()
 *              calling chain to recursively close the tree, but only the
 *              files that are still marked as closeable.  All files
 *              marked as closeable have their EFCs released, and will
 *              eventually be closed when their last parent EFC is
 *              released (the last part is guaranteed to be true by the
 *              first 2 passes).
 *
 * Return:      Non-negative on success
 *              Negative on failure

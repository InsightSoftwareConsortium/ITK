******** airOneLine()

** gets one line from "file", putting it into an array of given size.

** "line" was allocated for, not the number of non-null characters it
** was meant to hold.  "size" must be at least 3.  Always
** null-terminates the contents of the array (except if the arguments
** are invalid).  The idea is that the null-termination replaces the
** line termination.
**
** 0: if saw EOF before seeing a newline, or arguments are invalid
** 1: if line was a single newline
** n; n <= size: if line was n-1 characters followed by newline
** size+1: if didn't see a newline within size-1 characters
**
** So except for returns of -1 and size+1, the return is the number of
** characters comprising the line, including the newline character.
**
** For all you DOS\Windows\Cygwin users, this will quietly pretend that
** a "\r\n" pair is really just "\n", including the way that characters
** comprising the line are counted.  However, there is no pretension
** that on those platforms, "\n" by itself does not actually count as
** a newline.
**
** Finally, for those trafficking in legacy Mac text files (for which
** the line termination is only "\r", the same applies- these are also
** effectively treated the same as a newline.

** these aren't "const"s because the user should be able to change
** default behavior- until a more sophisticated mechanism for this
** kind of control is developed, it seems simple and usable enough to
** have this be global state which we agree to treat nicely, as in,
** threads shouldn't be changing these willy-nilly.
**
** What IS a "default"?  A default is the assertion of a certain
** choice in situations where the user hasn't set it explicitly, but
** COULD.  The pad value in resampling is a good example: it is set by
** a constructor to nrrdDefaultResamplePadValue, but the user can also set it
** explicitly.

          As of July 4 2012 GLK decides that the signalling NaN tests are
          more trouble than they're worth: the signal-ness of the NaN is not
          preserved in double-float conversion for some platforms (so
          airFP_SNAN == airFPClass_d(AIR_SNAN) has never been enforced), and
          there are more platforms for which (apparently) passing AIR_SNAN to
          airFPClass_d changes it to a quiet NaN, which defeats the purpose
          of the test.  To summarize, given that:
          ** AIR_NAN and AIR_QNAN are checked here to be quiet NaN, after
             casting to both float and double,
          ** quiet NaN "hi bit" is tested above, and that
          ** quiet and signalling NaN are mutually exclusive,
          skipping the signalling NaN tests is unlikely to undermine knowing
          the correctness of the compile-time representation of NaNs.  So the
          following line is now commented out for all platforms.

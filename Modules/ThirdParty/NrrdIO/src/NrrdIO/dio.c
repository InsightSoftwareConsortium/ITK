       the body of this function was bypassed (with "return
       airNoDio_disable;", for instance), then the problem went away.
       The problematic call seemed to be the fflush() below (Tue Feb 1
       06:47:33 EST 2005: which has since been removed with the change
       of this function's argument from a FILE * to an integral file
       descriptor).  I don't think direct I/O is possible on stdin,
       stdout, or stdout, since the fcntl() call below fails on stdin
       and stdout.  However, something about making that fcntl() call
       changes something which means that about half the time, the
       read() on a piped stdin fails (on an irix6.n32 O2, at
       least). So, seems to be safest to just explicitly say that
       direct I/O is unavailable, based solely on the file descriptor
       number (0, 1, 2).  */

// \brief Evaluation of univariate polynomials
// Templated class (on the data type of the coefficients),
// further very similar to the vnl_real_polynomial class,
// except that it uses std::vector instead of vnl_vector as data container,
// that the zero polynomial is represented by an empty vector,
// and that the coefficients go in the other direction.
//
// Important note on the implementation choice (reversed coefficient vector
// as opposed to the class vnl_real_npolynomial):
// The choice made here is definitely the more natural one, since it makes
// polynomials of different degrees much more naturally comparable, and hence
// simplifies the implementation of e.g. operator+(). Indeed: even if the
// degrees are different, the coefficients [i] of two polynomials are the ones
// to be considered together since they both refer to $X^i$. Also, normalizing
// the internal representation (in case the highest order coefficient is zero)
// now just needs to pop_back() instead of shifting the coefficients vector.
// In summary, the choice made here is both more natural and more performant.

//: Evaluation of polynomials.
//  vnl_polynomial<T> represents a univariate polynomial with
//  coefficients of datatype T, stored as a vector of values.
//  This allows evaluation of the polynomial $p(X)$ at given values of $X$,
//  and of its derivative $p'(X)$ or primitive function $\int p$.
//
//  The class also provides the common polynomial arithmetic, i.e.,
//  + - *, and even long division (through operators / and %).
//
//  The coefficients (coeffs_) are stored as a vector, starting with
//  the constant term. Hence coeffs_[n] is the coefficient of $X^n$,

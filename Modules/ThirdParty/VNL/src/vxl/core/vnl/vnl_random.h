// \brief A superior random number generator

constexpr unsigned int vnl_random_array_size = 37;

//: A superior random number generator.
// Implements a new random number generator that
// recently appeared in the literature. It generates 32 bit
// numbers with a higher degree of randomness than previous
// generators and has a cycle of 10^354 i.e. so huge that in
// practice it never cycles.
// For the mathematics behind it see:
// "A New Class of Random Number Generators" G. Marsaglia and A. Zaman,
// Annals of Applied Probability 1991, Vol. 1, No. 3, 462.

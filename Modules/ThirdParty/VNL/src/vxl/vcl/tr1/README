This directory is for compilers that are ISO and provide TR1
extensions for the upcoming C++0x standard.  This assumes
the TR1 extensions for <blah> are in <tr1/blah> and defined in 
namespace std::tr1

(in vcl_blah.h)

If your compiler is ISO 0x compliant with all functions defined
in <blah> and namespace std then

#include "iso/vcl_blah_tr1.h"
#include "iso/vcl_blah.h"

If your compiler is ISO compliant with TR1 extensions then

#include "tr1/vcl_blah.h"
#include "iso/vcl_blah.h"

If your compiler is ISO compliant with no 0x support then

#include "emulation/vcl_new_blah_related_files.h"
#include "iso/vcl_blah.h"



All of the .h files in this directory should look like this:
  #include <tr1/blah>
  #define vcl_generic_blah_tr1_STD std::tr1
  #include "../generic/vcl_blah_tr1.h"

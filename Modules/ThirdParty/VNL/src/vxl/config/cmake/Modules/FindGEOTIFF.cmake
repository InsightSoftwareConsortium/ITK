# Find a GEOTIFF library
#
# This file is used to manage using either a natively provided GEOTIFF library or the one in v3p if provided.

# As per the standard scheme the following definitions are used
# GEOTIFF_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find geotiff.h
# GEOTIFF_LIBRARIES   - the set of libraries to include to use GEOTIFF.
# GEOTIFF_FOUND       - TRUE, if available somewhere on the system.

# Additionally
# VXL_USING_NATIVE_GEOTIFF  - True if we are using a GEOTIFF library provided outside vxl (or v3p)

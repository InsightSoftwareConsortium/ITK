# Find a PNG library
#
#
# This file is used to manage using either a natively provided PNG library or the one in v3p if provided.
#
#
# As per the standard scheme the following definitions are used
# PNG_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find png.h
# PNG_LIBRARIES   - the set of libraries to include to use PNG.
# PNG_DEFINITIONS - You should ADD_DEFINITONS(${PNG_DEFINITIONS}) before compiling code that includes png library files.
# PNG_FOUND       - TRUE, if available somewhere on the system.

# Additionally
# VXL_USING_NATIVE_PNG  - True if we are using a PNG library provided outsidevxl (or v3p)


# If this FORCE variable is unset or is FALSE, try to find a native library.
if( VXL_FORCE_V3P_PNG )

# Suppress not found messages

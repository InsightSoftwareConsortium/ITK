"""Python CastXML or GCC-XML front end.

This package provides functionality to extract and inspect
declarations from C/C++ header files. This is accomplished
by invoking an external tool like CastXML or GCC-XML,
which parses a header file and dumps the declarations as a
XML file. This XML file is then read by pygccxml and the contents
are made available as appropriate Python objects.

To parse a set of C/C++ header files you use the :func:`parse <parser.parse>`
function in the :mod:parser sub package which returns a tree that contains all
declarations found in the header files. The root of the tree represents the
main namespace `::` and the children nodes represent the namespace contents
such as other namespaces, classes, functions, etc. Each node in the tree is an
object of a type derived from the :class:`declaration_t` class. An inner node
is always either a namespace :class:`declarations.namespace_t` or a class
:class:`declarations.class_t`, which are both derived from
:class:`declarations.scopedef_t` class. Everything else (free functions,
member functions, enumerations, variables, etc.) are always a leaf. You will
find all those declaration classes in the :mod:declarations sub-package.

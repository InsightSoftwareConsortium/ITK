-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Historical Note:

The Insight Toolkit (ITK) was initially developed
under contract to the National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes
of Health. ITK is partially derived from VTK and VXL, hence some code is
copyrighted accordingly (see VTKCopyright.txt and VXLCopyright.txt).

The copyright of most of the files in the "Utilities" subdirectory is held by
third parties who allow to distribute this material under a license compatible
with the one used by ITK. Please read the content of the subdirectories for
specific details on those third-party licenses. You will also find details in
the README.txt file under the "Copyright" subdirectory.

Starting with its version ITK 3.6, The Insight Toolkit is distributed under the
new and simplified BSD license approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI)
[http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php].

Starting with its version ITK 4, The Insight Toolkit is distributed under the
Apache 2.0 License. The move from the BSD license to the Apache 2.0 was
discussed at the October 2009 Insight Software Consortium Board Meeting,
discussed until December 14th, 2009 and the Insight Software Consortium Board
voted and approved the transition to Apache 2.0 license during a period from
December 15, 2009 to January 14th, 2010 to move to the Apache 2.0 License.

On November 26th, 2019 the Insight Software Consortium transferred the ITK
copyright to NumFOCUS following a vote by the Insight Software Consortium
Board of Directors.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The Toolkit contains code from third parties that have different
copyrights.

They are:


 1) DICOMParser:  Copyright by Matt Turek.
                  Distributed under a BSD-Like license.
                  [This work was funded by NLM so its copyright
                   should probably be transfered to the ISC.]

 2) AnalyzeDB.h:  The Mayo Clinic aggreed to distribute this file
                  with ITK. Point of contact: Vincent Magnotta.
                  The file was moved to Utilities/itkExtHdrs

 3) PixelData:    GE Copyrights,
                  Vincent is contacting the providers of this
                  code too.

 6) Netlib:       Netlib is a conglomerate of packages. Each
                  one having different copyrights and licenses.
                  Here is a listing of what is included inside
                  Utilities/vxl/v3p/netlib

    blas:         From www.netlib.org/blas :

    FAQ: The reference BLAS is a freely-available software package.
    It is available from netlib via anonymous ftp and the World Wide Web.
    Thus, it can be included in commercial software packages (and has been).
    We only ask that proper credit be given to the authors.


    datapac:   Written by James Filliben, National Bureau of Standars.

           Our understanding is that the US Government cannot hold
           copyrights, therefore we assume that this code is in the
           public domain.

    eispack:

    lapack:

    laso:

    libf2c:

    linalg:

    linpack:

    mathews:

    minpack:

    napack:

    opt:

    temperton:

    tests:

    toms:



 7) The triangle.c/h and showme.c files have been removed.
                  Their copyright/license was incompatible with
                  ITK and their functionality was not needed.
                  These removed the "itknetlib" library.


 8) itk_hash_map:  It has copyrights by SGI and HP, but the license
                  is consistent with BSD-like. So we simply need
                  to acknowledge those in our general copyright.

 9) itkMersenneTwisterRandomVariateGenerator:
                Copyright: Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura,
                Copyright: Richard J. Wagner
                under a BSD-Like license.

 10) Code/Numerics/FEM/dsrc2c.c :

                Copyright: 1977 IMSL Inc, no license available.
                Stephen Aylward removed the specific functions
                in this file that were copyrighted by IMSL and
                replaced them with other functions available in
                netlib. The file is now cleared from copyright
                concerns.


 11) Code/Numerics/cvsrmvend

                Copyright:  Greg A. Woods
                "Freely distributable"
                I guess that counts as BSD...
                Easy to remove if it becomes a problem,
                This is just a script for making easier
                the CVS syncs of VXL.

  12) Testing/Code/Numerics/NeuralNetworks:

                Copyright: CADDLab at UNC
                Fixed now in CVS --> ISC



Utilities:


  A) JPEG      :  Thomas G Lane ( BSD-Like)
               :  DCMTK : OFFIS... and many others... but BSD-Like


  B) OpenJPEG  :  Universite Catholique de Louvain:  BSD license


  C) NrrdIO      :  Gordon Kindlmann and  University of Utah
                  BSD-Like license. Clarifies that the original
                  package "Teem" (not in ITK) is still under GPL license


  D) NIFTI     :  No copyright ?
                  There is no mention of licensing nor copyright
                  at the NIFTI Web site:

                      http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1

                  However at http://niftilib.sourceforge.net it
                  appears as "public domain" license, but in
                  its subdirectory matlibs it has a GPL license.
                  The matlibs subdirectory is not included in ITK.

                  The subdirectory jlibs is public domain
                  The subdirecotry clibs is public domain


     in ITK it had a subdir:

        fsliolib  :  From the FSL package:
                     University of Oxford:
                     NO FOR COMMERCIAL USE

                     This code has now been removed.


  E) EXPAT     : Thai Open Source Software Center Ltd and Clark Cooper.
                 with BSD-Like license


  F) PNG       : Copyright: Glen Randers-Pehrson

    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal

Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent

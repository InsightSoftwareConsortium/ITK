Welcome to the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK)
==================================================================

Here are suggested steps for the ITK beginner. Please refer to [ITK] for more
information.

  1. Get the software at the
     [ITK software resources](https://itk.org/ITK/resources/software.html)

  2. The software is compiled using [CMake]. Sections 2.2 and 3.7 of the
     [ITK Software Guide] will help you configuring and building ITK.

  3. Join the [ITK discussion]. Go to
     [ITK Getting Started with Discourse](https://discourse.itk.org/t/getting-started-with-discourse/22)
     and follow the instructions there. You may choose to receive a digest
     version of the mail to minimize traffic.

  4. Learn the system. Start by looking at the examples found in the
     `ITK/Examples` directory. Note that this code is heavily commented and
     works with the [ITK Software Guide]. To build the examples, make sure the
     CMake flag `BUILD_EXAMPLES` is `ON`. See also the [Sphinx examples] and
     the [Wiki examples].
